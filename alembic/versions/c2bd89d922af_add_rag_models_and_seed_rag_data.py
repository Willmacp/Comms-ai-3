        "description": """This document contains information on:

Alt text – Alternative text (alt text) is a textual description of an image, photograph or other visual content for blind or partially-sighted people who use screen reading software.
Captioning and transcripts – Captions are a text version of the spoken part of audio-visual content. They will help people who are hard of hearing and those who have learning difficulties. Closed captions allow the user to switch on or off, open captions are part of the content itself.
Colour contrast – People with visual impairments prefer to read text that stands out strongly against a background on screen, or paper. You can achieve this by using good contrast between text and background colour.
Use of emojis – Emojis can be a useful tool to engage younger audiences on social media. But it is important that they are used carefully and sparingly. Every icon has its own description. Every description is unique and many even vary depending on the platform, browser or device that an emoji is being viewed on.
Use of hashtags – You should make sure your hashtags are accessible to those with visual and cognitive impairments and those who have dyslexia. Hashtags can be misread and screen readers will read out the hashtag as one word if they are not formatted correctly. You must make sure each word in multi-word hashtags is discernible for those with visual impairments who use assistive technology. Lowercase and uppercase letters help a screen reader identify separate words, allowing it to pronounce hashtags correctly. This is one of the easiest accessibility best practices to incorporate into your content. Properly formatted hashtags are normally easier for everyone to read, no matter the status of their vision.
British Sign Language (BSL) – There are around 150,000 BSL users in the United Kingdom, over half of whom are deaf. There is no statutory requirement for all government communications to be translated into BSL. But, all government departments are expected to continuously improve their provision of BSL.
Simple language – Writing in plain language helps your audience understand your content more quickly, and is easier for someone with a cognitive disability to understand. Clear writing can make content easier to understand, especially by those less familiar with the topic, people who are not fluent in the language, and people with low literacy.""",

The plans *must* also include clear metrics to support the delivery of the cross-government and organisational objectives, approved by the organisation’s board (or equivalent). \n\nStrong leadership skills are critical to the successful delivery of effective and efficient government communications. As leaders, Directors and Heads of Communication set the vision for their teams, a vision which *must* support a shared vision of communications across government. Directors and Heads of Communication are expected to make a corporate contribution to GCS by working on cross-government projects such as the delivery of the Strategy Commitments. The following leadership objective *must* be included in annual performance and development plans of all Senior Civil Service (SCS) leaders:\n\n“GCS SCS to play an active role in championing the three pillars of the GCS Strategy 2022-25 by promoting collaboration, increasing efficiency and innovation, supporting great people and raising professional standards, and contributing to the delivery of the GCS strategy commitments.”\n\nWe will support SCS leaders in doing this by setting out clear expectations, a new leadership capability framework (to be launched Autumn 2024) and targeted key skills development to ensure they stay up to date in areas such as the latest trends in technology.

This does not mean needing seven separate siloed teams. In the spirit of a multi-disciplinary approach, it means having those skills somewhere in the team and available to others.\n\nNew design principles for Digital content teams have been developed to reflect the creation of Digital as a new discipline.

They are accountable for ensuring their whole organisation, including ALBs and embedded communicators, complies with the Functional Standard GovS011: Communication, (available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-011-communication). They are also accountable for their whole organisation aligning to the vision and strategies of GCS, and for building their professional communications capability and skills.\n\nDirectors and Heads of Communication *should* have oversight of relevant recruitment across their whole organisation, including embedded communicators and sponsored ALBs. For example, this would include agreeing job descriptions and participating in selection panels.\n\nThis section contains the principles which Directors and Heads of Communication *should* follow to establish collaborative partnerships between ALBs and sponsoring departments.\n\nA helpful overview of how ALBs should link to Directors of Communication and the Head of Profession can be found in the overall Government Functional Standard – GovS 001 (figure 6 on page 17, available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-001-government-functions).\n\n### Effective working between ALBs and Sponsor Departments\n\nThe principles in the ALB/Sponsor department working guidance set out how Directors and Heads of Communication should approach building strong links between ALBs and Sponsor departments, namely:\n\n- Where an organisation is part of an ALB cluster, duplication should be removed, and closer, integrated working should be the norm.\n- Organisations do not necessarily need every capability in-house, and should look at sharing service opportunities across a group, or across the GCS.\n- Sponsor departments should make sure the right processes are in place to quality assure all ALBs – without inhibiting ALB autonomy and expertise – and encourage and enable access to the GCS learning offer.\n\nSensible collaboration doesn’t preclude operational independence. It means coming together where there are shared interests without limiting the ability to pursue individual responsibilities.\n\n### Working with embedded communicators\n\nMany organisations across government will have ‘embedded’ communications teams or staff working outside the core communications function. Directors and Heads of Communications should establish links and reporting lines that foster strong collaboration and oversight, as well as ensuring embedded communicators are delivering high quality communications work consistent with GCS and organisational standards, and have access to career and skills development and learning.\n\nAs a starting point, a Director or Head of Communication *should* know how many embedded professional communicators work within their organisation, what communications work they are undertaking and the level of communication skills.\n\nDirectors and Heads of Communication should have the same commitment to upskilling all communicators in their organisations, and direct them towards the guidance and skills training provided by GCS. Civil servants looking to recruit embedded roles should seek approval from their Director or Head of Communication before recruitment to check that the relevant activity cannot be supported by the central team and to avoid duplication.\n\nDirectors and Heads of Communication *should* read and adopt the principles for working with embedded communicators and reflect the learning from within the case study from DfE, where relevant. These will help to foster greater collaboration and enable you to fulfil the obligations set out in GovS001 (available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-001-government-functions).",

However, campaign teams *must* demonstrate a lawful basis for processing personal data under UK GDPR within their Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) if they are planning to reach audiences through this approach. Further guidance is available from the GCS website – ICO Direct Marketing campaign guidance (available at https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/marketing/delivering-government-campaigns/ico-campaign-guidance/) and from the Information Commissioner Officer’s website – Compliant use of Direct Marketing approaches (available at https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/direct-marketing-and-the-public-sector/).

Alt text – Alternative text (alt text) is a textual description of an image, photograph or other visual content for blind or partially-sighted people who use screen reading software.
Captioning and transcripts – Captions are a text version of the spoken part of audio-visual content. They will help people who are hard of hearing and those who have learning difficulties. Closed captions allow the user to switch on or off, open captions are part of the content itself.

Colour contrast – People with visual impairments prefer to read text that stands out strongly against a background on screen, or paper. You can achieve this by using good contrast between text and background colour.

Use of emojis – Emojis can be a useful tool to engage younger audiences on social media. But it is important that they are used carefully and sparingly. Every icon has its own description. Every description is unique and many even vary depending on the platform, browser or device that an emoji is being viewed on.

Use of hashtags – You should make sure your hashtags are accessible to those with visual and cognitive impairments and those who have dyslexia. Hashtags can be misread and screen readers will read out the hashtag as one word if they are not formatted correctly. You must make sure each word in multi-word hashtags is discernible for those with visual impairments who use assistive technology. Lowercase and uppercase letters help a screen reader identify separate words, allowing it to pronounce hashtags correctly. This is one of the easiest accessibility best practices to incorporate into your content. Properly formatted hashtags are normally easier for everyone to read, no matter the status of their vision.

British Sign Language (BSL) – There are around 150,000 BSL users in the United Kingdom, over half of whom are deaf. There is no statutory requirement for all government communications to be translated into BSL. But, all government departments are expected to continuously improve their provision of BSL.

Simple language – Writing in plain language helps your audience understand your content more quickly, and is easier for someone with a cognitive disability to understand. Clear writing can make content easier to understand, especially by those less familiar with the topic, people who are not fluent in the language, and people with low literacy.""",

To rebuild Britain, we need to change how Britain is governed. For too long, Britain has been held back by governments that, because they lack a relentless focus on long-term ends, are buffeted about by events. Politics has enormous potential to change lives for the better, but too often different parts of the government have pursued their own narrow goals rather than working together. Government is at its best when working in partnership with business, trade unions, civil society, faith groups, and communities.

Mission-driven government means raising our sights as a nation and focusing on ambitious, measurable, long-term objectives that provide a driving sense of purpose for the country. It means a new way of doing government that is more joined up, pushes power out to communities and harnesses new technology, all with one aim in mind – to put the country back in the service of working people.\nLabour’s five missions to rebuild Britain are:\n1) Kickstart economic growth to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 – with good jobs and productivity growth in every part of the country making everyone, not just a few, better off. 2) Make Britain a clean energy superpower to cut bills, create jobs and deliver security with cheaper, zero-carbon electricity by 2030, accelerating to net zero. 3) Take back our streets by halving serious violent crime and raising confidence in the police and criminal justice system to its highest levels. 4) Break down barriers to opportunity by reforming our childcare and education systems, to make sure there is no class ceiling on the ambitions of young people in Britain. 5) Build an NHS fit for the future that is there when people need it; with fewer lives lost to the biggest killers; in a fairer Britain, where everyone lives well for longer. Delivering the change Britain needs will require perseverance. The starting point for delivering these missions is to ensure the foundations of good government are right. Labour will make sure we have strong national security, secure borders, and economic stability. Building on these secure foundations, we have already set out the first steps for change. Today we present further policies in this manifesto, as part of the journey of rebuilding our country. Every policy that follows in this manifesto is fully costed and fully funded.",

Now Putin is attempting to break European security with his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Labour will meet this challenge by strengthening our armed forces and protecting our national security.\nOur commitment to the UK’s nuclear deterrent is absolute. It is a vital safeguard for the UK and our NATO allies. As the party that founded NATO, we maintain our unshakeable commitment to the alliance, and we will apply a NATO test to major defence programmes to ensure we meet our obligations in full. In recent years, threats to our safety and security have multiplied and diversified. Alongside greater conventional threats, we are faced with the growing emergence of hybrid warfare, including cyber-attacks and misinformation campaigns which seek to subvert our democracy. To ensure the UK is fully prepared to deal with these interconnected threats, Labour will conduct a Strategic Defence Review within our first year in government, and we will set out the path to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence. From the Skripal poisonings to assassination plots by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, threats from hostile states or statesponsored groups are on the rise, but Britain lacks a comprehensive framework to protect us. Labour will take the approach used for dealing with non-state terrorism and adapt it to deal with state-based domestic security threats. Terrorism remains a significant threat. Labour will bring in ‘Martyn’s Law’ to strengthen the security of public events and venues. We will update the rules around counterextremism, including online, to stop people being radicalised and drawn towards hateful ideologies.

Schemes like Homes for Ukraine, Hong Kong humanitarian visas, and the Syrian resettlement programme have provided important routes for refugees seeking sanctuary. But the system needs to be controlled and managed and we need strong borders. The small boats crisis, fuelled by dangerous criminal smuggler gangs, is undermining our security and costing lives.\nRather than a serious plan to confront this crisis, the Conservatives have offered nothing but desperate gimmicks. Their flagship policy – to fly a tiny number of asylum seekers to Rwanda – has already cost hundreds of millions of pounds. Even if it got off the ground, this scheme can only address fewer than one per cent of the asylum seekers arriving. It cannot work. Chaos in the Channel has been matched by chaos at home. The Conservatives’ unworkable laws have created a ‘perma-backlog’ of tens of thousands of asylum seekers, who are indefinitely staying in hotels costing the taxpayer millions of pounds every week. Labour will stop the chaos and go after the criminal gangs who trade in driving this crisis. We will create a new Border Security Command, with hundreds of new investigators, intelligence officers, and cross-border police officers. This will be funded by ending the wasteful Migration and Economic Development partnership with Rwanda. This new Command will work internationally and be supported by new counter-terrorism style powers, to pursue, disrupt, and arrest those responsible for the vile trade. We will seek a new security agreement with the EU to ensure access to real-time intelligence and enable our policing teams to lead joint investigations with their European counterparts. Labour will turn the page and restore order to the asylum system so that it operates swiftly, firmly, and fairly; and the rules are properly enforced. We will hire additional caseworkers to clear the Conservatives’ backlog and end asylum hotels, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds. Labour will set up a new returns and enforcement unit, with an additional 1,000 staff, to fast-track removals to safe countries for people who do not have the right to stay here. We will negotiate additional returns arrangements to speed up returns and increase the number of safe countries that failed asylum seekers can swiftly be sent back to. And we will also act upstream, working with international partners to address the humanitarian crises which lead people to flee their homes, and to strengthen support for refugees in their home region.",

Siren voices may claim that there are no limits on what government can spend, or that tax cuts pay for themselves. We reject this flawed ideology that was tested to destruction by the disastrous Conservative ‘mini budget’. The British people are still paying the price of those unfunded commitments through higher mortgage costs, and taxpayers continue to foot the bill through higher interest payments, meaning less money for investment and public services. The impact was not confined to these shores. The Conservatives’ recklessness sent a signal of instability across the world that damaged our standing, making Britain a less attractive place for business to invest. The chaos is not over. The desperate Conservatives have now made yet more unfunded tax cuts and spending promises at a scale beyond the ‘mini budget’. This would be devastating for families across the country. Labour will turn the page on this economic chaos. Our approach is based on strong fiscal rules which will govern every single decision we make in government. Our fiscal rules are that: • The current budget moves into balance, so that day-to-day costs are met by revenues • Debt must be falling as a share of the economy by the fifth year of the forecast. These rules allow for prudent investment in our economy. This represents a clear break from the Conservatives who have created an incentive to cut investment; a short-term approach that ignores the importance of growing the economy. Labour will strike a balance between prioritising investment and the urgent need to rebuild our public finances. There will be no return to austerity. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour will never sideline the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for political convenience. Instead, we will strengthen the role of the OBR. Every fiscal event making significant changes to taxation or spending will be subject to an independent OBR forecast. Labour will safeguard taxpayers’ money. We will end the link between access to ministers and an inside track for public contracts. We will appoint a fixed-term Covid Corruption Commissioner and use every means possible to recoup public money lost in pandemicrelated fraud and from contracts which have not delivered. And we will not tolerate fraud or waste anywhere, whether in social security or the excessive use of consultants. Alongside strong national finances, Britain needs resilient family finances too. The Conservatives have left families struggling with the cost of living. Labour will take action to support families, by tackling the underlying causes of the crisis.\nOur approach is based on strong fiscal rules which govern every single decision we make in government.\nWe will bring down the cost of energy. We will reduce food prices by removing barriers to businesses trading. We will make housing more affordable, expand access to childcare, and make work pay. We will support families with children by introducing free breakfast clubs in every primary school. Labour will also keep mortgage rates as low as possible, with a strong, independent Bank of England – which will continue to target stable inflation of 2 per cent. The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT. Labour will address unfairness in the tax system. We will abolish non-dom status once and for all, replacing it with a modern scheme for people genuinely in the country for a short period. We will end the use of offshore trusts to avoid inheritance tax so that everyone who makes their home here in the UK pays their taxes here. Private equity is the only industry where performancerelated pay is treated as capital gains. Labour will close this loophole. We will modernise HMRC and change the law to tackle tax avoidance. We will increase registration and reporting requirements, strengthen HMRC’s powers, invest in new technology and build capacity within HMRC. This, combined with a renewed focus on tax avoidance by large businesses and the wealthy, will begin to close the tax gap and ensure everyone pays their fair share. Labour will stop the chaos, turn the page, and return to the foundations of national security, secure borders, and economic stability.\nWe will bring down the cost of energy.

That’s the change we need.”\nIt is time to turn the page. Labour will restore stability, increase investment, and reform our economy.\nSustained economic growth is the only route to improving the prosperity of our country and the living standards of working people. That is why it is Labour’s first mission for government. It means being probusiness and pro-worker. We are the party of wealth creation. This election follows the chaos of the Conservatives’ ‘mini-budget’ and an unprecedented fall in living standards. Their miserable economic record over the past 14 years has seen productivity and wages flatlining, leaving British families significantly poorer than those in France or Germany. This decline is rooted in two failures. First, an inability to accept that a strong economy can only be built on the contribution of every community and every person – the many not the few. Second, a failure to acknowledge that sustainable growth requires government to be a strategic partner with business – that markets must be shaped, not merely served. These twin failures have led to greater economic insecurity – in the financial resilience of households, but also in our national economy – at the very time when our world has become less stable and secure. The Conservatives have failed to grasp the implications of a new era of rising global competition and tension, instead leaving our economy on an increasingly shallow and insecure footing. It is time to turn the page. Labour will restore stability, increase investment, and reform our economy. We will embrace a new approach to economic management – securonomics – that understands sustainable growth relies on a broad base and resilient foundations. Our approach will depend on a dynamic and strategic state. This does not mean ever-growing government, but it does mean a more active, smarter government that works in partnership with business, trade unions, local leaders, and devolved governments. Labour will stop the chaos and support business through a stable policy environment – strengthening our economic institutions, and giving investors the certainty they need to fuel growth. Labour will seek involvement from industry, trade unions, and civil society in our plans for growth, so they can contribute to building a stronger economy in all parts of the country. We will strategically use public investment where it can unlock additional private sector investment, create jobs, and provide a return for taxpayers. While stability and greater investment will support growth, parts of our economy require substantial reform if we are to create the wealth our country needs. Britain is hampered by a planning regime that means we struggle to build either the infrastructure or housing the country needs. The country remains too centralised, with the economic potential of too many regions and communities ignored. Our labour market fails to provide secure jobs and, as a result, for far too many people work does not pay. The innovation, dynamism and sheer hard work of British business and workers has never been in question. The next Labour government will partner with them to kickstart economic growth and rebuild Britain. \nThe innovation, dynamism and sheer hard work of British workers has never been in question.\nRichard Walker OBE, Executive Chairman of Iceland: “Labour’s plan for the economy is good news formy customers and colleagues in high streets across the country.

Public investment, where it supports and de-risks additional private investment, is one important tool being used successfully across the world. It can create good jobs across the country and would mean British taxpayers can reap the benefits of economic growth. To realise these opportunities Labour will establish a National Wealth Fund. Capitalised with £7.3 billion over the course of the next Parliament, the National Wealth Fund will have a remit to support Labour’s growth and clean energy missions, making transformative investments across every part of the country. The fund will have a target of attracting three pounds of private investment for every one pound of public investment, creating jobs across the country. We plan to allocate: • £1.8 billion to upgrade ports and build supply chains across the UK • £1.5 billion to new gigafactories so our automotive industry leads the world • £2.5 billion to rebuild our steel industry • £1 billion to accelerate the deployment of carbon capture • £500 million to support the manufacturing of green hydrogen. Labour will also act to increase investment from pension funds in UK markets.

Labour will cap corporation tax at the current level of 25 per cent, the lowest in the G7, for the entire parliament, and we will act if tax changes in other countries pose a risk to UK competitiveness. We will retain a permanent full expensing system for capital investment and the annual investment allowance for small business. And we will give firms greater clarity on what qualifies for allowances to improve business investment decisions. The current business rates system disincentivises investment, creates uncertainty and places an undue burden on our high streets.

This is not an accident. Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays, cost overruns, uncertainty for supply chains, and our infrastructure crumbling.\nWe need to forge ahead with new roads, railways, reservoirs, and other nationally significant infrastructure.\nLabour will end this chaos by developing a ten-year infrastructure strategy, aligned with our industrial strategy and regional development priorities, including improving rail connectivity across the north of England. The strategy will guide investment plans and give the private sector certainty about the project pipeline. We will work closely with business to map and address the delivery challenges we face. We will create a new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority, bringing together existing bodies, to set strategic infrastructure priorities and oversee the design, scope, and delivery of projects. The current planning regime acts as a major brake on economic growth.

We will fix an additional one million potholes across England in each year of the next parliament, funded by deferring the A27 bypass, which is poor value for money.

Labour will overhaul Britain’s railways. Fourteen years of Conservative neglect have failed passengers, businesses and taxpayers. We will put passengers at the heart of the service by reforming the railways and bringing them into public ownership. We will do this as contracts with existing operators expire or are broken through a failure to deliver, without costing taxpayers a penny in compensation. Great British Railways will deliver a unified system that focuses on reliable, affordable, high-quality, and efficient services; along with ensuring safety and accessibility. It will be responsible for investment, day-to-day operational delivery and innovations and improvements for passengers, working with publicly-owned rail operators in Wales and Scotland.

Labour will take a brownfield first approach, prioritising the development of previously used land wherever possible, and fast-tracking approval of urban brownfield sites. But brownfield development alone will not be enough to meet our housing need. Labour is committed to preserving the green belt which has served England’s towns and cities well over many decades.

Without changing its purpose or general extent, Labour will take a more strategic approach to greenbelt land designation and release to build more homes in the right places. The release of lower quality ‘grey belt’ land will be prioritised and we will introduce ‘golden rules’ to ensure development benefits communities and nature. In partnership with local leaders and communities, a Labour government will build a new generation of new towns, inspired by the proud legacy of the 1945 Labour government. Alongside urban extensions and regeneration projects, these will form part of a series of large-scale new communities across England. Housing need in England cannot be met without planning for growth on a larger than local scale so we will introduce effective new mechanisms for cross-boundary strategic planning. Labour will require all Combined and Mayoral Authorities to strategically plan for housing growth in their areas. We will give Combined Authorities new planning powers along with new freedoms and flexibilities to make better use of grant funding.

At the centre of our approach is a new statutory requirement for Local Growth Plans that cover towns and cities across the country.

Failure to do so reduces the incentives for businesses to train locally. So, Labour will reduce net migration. We will reform the points-based immigration system so that it is fair and properly managed, with appropriate restrictions on visas, and by linking immigration and skills policy. Labour will not tolerate employers or recruitment agencies abusing the visa system. And we will not stand for breaches of employment law. Employers who flout the rules will be barred from hiring workers from abroad. Conservative policy is incoherent, with decisions on migration, skills and sectoral pay determined in isolation. Labour will bring joined-up thinking, ensuring that migration to address skills shortages triggers a plan to upskill workers and improve working conditions in the UK. We will strengthen the Migration Advisory Committee, and establish a framework for joint working with skills bodies across the UK, the Industrial Strategy Council and the Department for Work and Pensions. We will end the long-term reliance on overseas workers in some parts of the economy by bringing in workforce and training plans for sectors such as health and social care, and construction. The days of a sector languishing endlessly on immigration shortage lists with no action to train up workers will come to an end.",

This will include banning exploitative zero hours contracts; ending fire and rehire; and introducing basic rights from day one to parental leave, sick pay, and protection from unfair dismissal. We will strengthen the collective voice of workers, including through their trade unions, and create a Single Enforcement Body to ensure employment rights are upheld. These changes will improve the lives of working people across the entire UK. Labour will also make sure the minimum wage is a genuine living wage.

I’ve lived in this house all my life and I’ve never struggled this much to keep warm. I can only afford to heat one room with a small portable heater. Sometimes I sleep in my armchair to save money. It’s no way to live. Labour is the only party with a proper plan to cut energy bills for good and get us back on track. The savings people will get through things like Great British Energy will make a real difference to me. No question.”\nThe climate and nature crisis is the greatest long-term global challenge that we face. The clean energy transition represents a huge opportunity to generate growth, tackle the cost-of-living crisis and make Britain energy independent once again. That is why clean energy by 2030 is Labour’s second mission. The Conservatives have failed to grasp opportunities in this area for two related reasons. First, because they simply do not accept that economic growth, energy security, lower bills, and addressing climate change can be complementary. Second, because they are ideologically opposed to using the role of the state, including public investment, to guarantee that they are. The damage done by 14 years of chaotic ‘sticking plaster’ policies was exposed when Putin invaded Ukraine. The cost of fossil fuel energy on the international market rocketed. The Conservatives’ ban on new onshore wind, failure to build new nuclear power stations, and decision to scrap investment in home insulation landed British families with amongst the highest energy bills in Europe. That is just one way we are paying the price. While countries around the world are racing ahead to claim the jobs and wealth that the transition offers, Britain is losing out. But it is not too late to stop the chaos and turn the page. We have tremendous untapped advantages: our long coastline, high winds, shallow waters, universities, and skilled offshore workforce combined with our extensive technological and engineering capabilities. With a serious industrial strategy and a genuine partnership between the public and private sectors, we can make Britain a clean energy superpower. Labour will take decisive action to seize this economic opportunity. We will shape markets, and use public investment to crowd in private funding. At the heart of our approach will be our Green Prosperity Plan where, in partnership with business through our National Wealth Fund, we will invest in the industries of the future. Our plan will create 650,000 jobs across the country by 2030. We will end the chaotic Conservative chopping and changing on policy, harness clean power to boost our energy security, and invest in home insulation upgrades. We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good. We will provide leadership at home so we can influence others to ensure every country plays their part in meeting our collective obligations to future generations. At home we will also tackle the Conservatives’ nature emergency, including the unforgivable pollution of our rivers and seas. We will improve access to nature, promote biodiversity, and protect our landscapes and wildlife. Labour understands the road ahead. We have been clear that this transition presents an opportunity to create good jobs, with no community left behind, and support well-paying jobs in existing and future industries. The Conservatives propose an alternative course. A denial of reality; delaying action; increasing costs for Britain; exposing us to insecurity; and a failure to win the jobs of the future. They tried this chaotic approach in the 1970s and 80s, and communities are still scarred by what happened.

Britain can lead on this by treating this mission like the vaccine challenge. We can be the innovators and the implementers, helping ourselves and exporting our solutions worldwide. But if we choose to go slowly, others will provide the answers, and ultimately we’ll end up buying these solutions rather than selling them.”\nFamilies and businesses will have lower bills for good, from a zerocarbon electricity system. We have chosen this mission not because it is easy, but because working people can never again be left vulnerable to dictators like Putin. To deliver our clean power mission, Labour will work with the private sector to double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. We will invest in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and marine energy, and ensure we have the long-term energy storage our country needs. A new Energy Independence Act will establish the framework for Labour’s energy and climate policies. Labour will end a decade of dithering that has seen the Conservatives duck decisions on nuclear power. We will ensure the long-term security of the sector, extending the lifetime of existing plants, and we will get Hinkley Point C over the line. New nuclear power stations, such as Sizewell C, and Small Modular Reactors, will play an important role in helping the UK achieve energy security and clean power while securing thousands of good, skilled jobs. \nLabour will create a new publiclyowned company, Great British Energy. It will be owned by the British people and deliver power back to the British peopl.\nLabour will maintain a strategic reserve of gas power stations to guarantee security of supply. We will ensure a phased and responsible transition in the North Sea that recognises the proud history of our offshore industry and the brilliance of its workforce, particularly in Scotland and the North East of England, and the ongoing role of oil and gas in our energy mix. We will embrace the future of energy production and storage which will make use of existing offshore infrastructure and the skills of our offshore workforce. Labour will not revoke existing licences and we will partner with business and workers to manage our existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan. Crucially, oil and gas production in the North Sea will be with us for decades to come, and the North Sea will be managed in a way that does not jeopardise jobs. And our offshore workers will lead the world in the industries of the future. We will not issue new licences to explore new fields because they will not take a penny off bills, cannot make us energy secure, and will only accelerate the worsening climate crisis. In addition, we will not grant new coal licences and will ban fracking for good. To support investment in this plan, Labour will close the loopholes in the windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Companies have benefitted from enormous profits not because of their ingenuity or investment, but because of an energy shock which raised prices for British families. Labour will therefore extend the sunset clause in the Energy Profits Levy until the end of the next parliament.

We will work with prisons to improve offenders’ access to purposeful activity, such as learning, and ensure they create pre-release plans for those leaving custody. We will support prisons to link up with local employers and the voluntary sector to get ex-offenders into work. The children of those who are imprisoned are at far greater risk of being drawn into crime than their peers. We will ensure that those young people are identified and offered support to break the cycle. After 14 years of chaotic reorganisations, the national probation service is struggling to keep the public safe. A lack of co-ordination between prisons, probation and other local services also means prison-leavers are not getting the right support, raising the risk that they go straight back to crime. In some areas of the country, we have seen Labour Mayors pioneering a more joined-up approach to reduce reoffending. In Greater Manchester, probation is linked up with housing and health services to ensure offenders leaving custody receive the support they need. Labour will conduct a strategic review of probation governance, including considering the benefits of devolved models.",

I taught Spanish to Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Education Bridget Phillipson. Having been a headteacher, it is my privilege to support Labour’s plans for 6,500 new teachers, free breakfast clubs in every primary school, and to give all children the chance to take part in music, sport, and the arts. Bridget and her colleagues in government will continue to make that difference.”\nWhoever you are, wherever you come from, Britain should be a country where hard work means you can get on in life. Under the Conservatives, this basic promise – that if you work hard, you will enjoy the rewards – has been broken. We are a country where who your parents are – and how much money they have – too often counts for more than your effort and enterprise. Too many people see success as something that happens to others. This is an appalling waste of talent as well as a huge injustice. So, breaking the pernicious link between background and success will be a defining mission for Labour. First, we must recognise that greater opportunity requires greater security. Tackling economic insecurity – at work, at home, in our communities and public services – is the golden thread that runs through all of Labour’s missions. On that secure foundation, we can build an education system that prepares our children for life, work, and the future. Our education system is struggling to cope after years of chronic mismanagement under the Conservatives. Childcare and early education are increasingly unaffordable and unavailable. Too many children arrive at primary school not ready to learn. Too many children are not even getting to school. Teachers are burnt out and leaving in droves. Fewer people are participating in apprenticeships and training. Higher education is in crisis. Meanwhile, too many of our young people leave school unprepared for the future. Labour will transform our education system so that young people get the opportunities they deserve. We will expand our childcare and early-years system, drive up standards, modernise the school curriculum, reform assessment, and create higher-quality training and employment paths by empowering local communities to develop the skills people need. We will also put employers at the heart of our skills system. Every child should believe that success belongs to them. Education has so often been the spark that can light a fire within, transforming life chances. It is time to light that fire for the whole country.\nImelda Staunton CBE, Actor “I welcome Labour’s proposals set out by Keir Starmer to broaden opportunity and make sure all young people have access to the arts. Opening up access to creativity in our schools is critical, not just so that our children have a better chance at a career in the arts, but because access is what will fuel growth in the creative industries — one of the most important sectors for the future of the economy — creating good jobs in all corners of the country.”\nLabour will stop the chaos, end the failure and division of the last 14 years, and turn the page to ensure everyone can thrive.",

That progress transformed life chances and ensured security in retirement. The next Labour government will build on that legacy of pursuing opportunity and social justice. Good work will be the foundation of our approach to tackling poverty and inequality. We will create more good jobs, reform employment support, and make work pay so that many more people benefit from the dignity and purpose of work. Labour is committed to reviewing Universal Credit so that it makes work pay and tackles poverty. We want to end mass dependence on emergency food parcels, which is a moral scar on our society. Child poverty has gone up by 700,000 under the Conservatives, with over four million children now growing up in a low-income family. Last year, a million children experienced destitution. This not only harms children’s lives now, it damages their future prospects, and holds back our economic potential as a country. Labour will develop an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty. We will work with the voluntary sector, faith organisations, trade unions, business, devolved and local government, and communities to bring about change. We will take initial steps to confront poverty by introducing free breakfast clubs in every primary school, protecting renters from arbitrary eviction, slashing fuel poverty, banning exploitative zero hours contracts, and improving support to help people get into good work. Our system of state, private, and workplace pensions provide the basis for security in retirement. Labour will retain the triple lock for the state pension. We will also adopt reforms to workplace pensions to deliver better outcomes for UK savers and pensioners. Our pensions review will consider what further steps are needed to improve security in retirement, as well as to increase productive investment in the UK economy. Security also means having a secure roof over your head. That is not the case for too many renting their homes privately. Labour will legislate where the Conservatives have failed, overhauling the regulation of the private rented sector. We will immediately abolish Section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions, prevent private renters being exploited and discriminated against, empower them to challenge unreasonable rent increases, and take steps to decisively raise standards, including extending ‘Awaab’s Law’ to the private sector. Labour will also take decisive action to improve building safety, including through regulation, to ensure we never again see a repeat of the Grenfell fire. We will review how to better protect leaseholders from costs and take steps to accelerate the pace of remediation across the country. We will put a renewed focus on ensuring those responsible for the building safety crisis pay to put it right. For far too many leaseholders, the reality of home ownership falls woefully short of the dream they were promised. Labour will act where the Conservatives have failed and finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end. We will enact the package of Law Commission proposals on leasehold enfranchisement, right to manage and commonhold. We will take further steps to ban new leasehold flats and ensure commonhold is the default tenure. We will tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent charges. We will act to bring the injustice of ‘fleecehold’ private housing estates and unfair maintenance costs to an end. The last Labour government made huge strides in ending homelessness. Under the Conservatives, that progress has been undone, with rough sleepers an all-too-common sight in our towns and cities, and a sharp rise in hidden homelessness. Building on the lessons of our past, Labour will develop a new cross-government strategy, working with Mayors and Councils across the country, to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness.",

Most children attend schools where the Conservatives are failing to provide the support and teaching that they need. Labour will end the VAT exemption and business rates relief for private schools to invest in our state schools. The factor that makes the biggest difference to a child’s education is high-quality teaching; but there are shortages of qualified teachers across the country. Labour will recruit an additional 6,500 new expert teachers. We will get more teachers into shortage subjects, support areas that face recruitment challenges, and tackle retention issues. The way bursaries are allocated, and the structure of retention payments, will be reviewed. Teaching is a hard-earned and hard-learned skill, Labour will work to further raise its status. We will update the Early Career Framework, maintaining its grounding in evidence, and ensure any new teacher entering the classroom has, or is working towards, Qualified Teacher Status. We will introduce a new Teacher Training Entitlement to ensure teachers stay up to date on best practice with continuing professional development. School support staff play a vital role in children’s education and development. Labour will reinstate the School Support Staff Negotiating Body, which will help address the acute recruitment and retention crisis in support roles. Raising school standards starts with early education. The last Labour government’s promotion of phonics put rocket boosters under the reading and writing ability of a generation of children. We will do the same for numeracy, improving the quality of maths teaching across nurseries and primary schools. Developing early communication skills is another key foundation for life, with serious knock-on consequences when development is delayed. Labour will fund evidence-based early-language interventions in primary schools, so that every child can find their voice. Alongside high-quality teaching, driving up standards in education requires outstanding leadership. Labour will create a new Excellence in Leadership Programme, a mentoring framework that expands the capacity of headteachers and leaders to improve their schools. Labour will introduce new Regional Improvement Teams, to enhance school-to-school support, and spread best practice. Accountability is non-negotiable, which is why Labour supports school inspection. Under the Conservatives our inspection regime has been broken. A system which declares nine in ten schools are good or outstanding fails to provide sufficient information on school performance. We will enhance the inspection regime by replacing a single headline grade with a new report card system telling parents clearly how schools are performing. We will also bring Multi-Academy Trusts into the inspection system and introduce a new annual review of safeguarding, attendance, and off-rolling. Every child should have a broad curriculum with an excellent foundation in reading, writing and maths, and support to develop essential digital, speaking, and creative skills. Yet today, too many are missing out. Labour will launch an expert-led review of curriculum and assessment, working with school staff, parents and employers to change this. Our reforms will build on the hard work of teachers who have brought their subjects alive with knowledge rich syllabuses, to deliver a curriculum which is rich and broad, inclusive, and innovative. To capture this breadth, our review will consider the right balance of assessment methods whilst protecting the important role of examinations. Too often our education and care systems do not meet the needs of all children, including those with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). Labour will take a community-wide approach, improving inclusivity and expertise in mainstream schools, as well as ensuring special schools cater to those with the most complex needs. We will make sure admissions decisions account for the needs of communities and require all schools to co-operate with their local authority on school admissions, SEND inclusion, and place planning. Too many children’s life chances are being scarred by rising poverty. Too many arrive at school not ready to learn, and too many are absent. Breakfast clubs improve behaviour, attendance, and learning. Labour will fund free breakfast clubs in every primary school, accessible to all children. Our breakfast clubs will support parents through the cost-of-living crisis. We will also bring down the cost of school by limiting the number of branded items of uniform and PE kit that schools can require. Poor mental health is another barrier to learning. The struggle to access support is paralysing children and young people through their formative years. Labour will provide access to specialist mental health professionals in every school, so every young person has access to early support to address problems before they escalate. This will complement our plan for Young Futures Hubs, which will make sure every community has an open-access hub for children and young people with drop-in mental health support.",

And we are committed to devolving adult skills funding to Combined Authorities, empowering local leaders to have greater control of skills development in their areas, alongside a greater role in supporting people into work. Skills England will co-ordinate between local areas to ensure everyone can access all the opportunities available.

They’ve let the country down badly. My wife is a teacher at a local school and I’m a security manager in London. We love living in Thurrock. But over the last ten years things have gotten worse. Booking the dentist for my daughter was a nightmare. We had to wait over a year for an appointment. We switched and voted Labour at the local elections. Keir Starmer is a good man. His plan to get more NHS appointments is so important. He’ll deliver it.”\nThe 1945 Labour government founded our National Health Service on principles that have stood the test of time: The best health services should be available, free for all. Money should no longer be the passport to the best treatment. People should get the best that modern science can offer. For decades the NHS has served us well, with those values enduring. These are the principles which will underpin the next Labour government’s plan to reform the NHS. But as we look at the NHS now, it is clearly broken – and the Conservatives broke it. Whilst the Covid-19 pandemic placed the NHS under unprecedented stress, the reality is waiting lists were at record highs even before it struck. Rather than healthcare being ‘free for all’, we now find ourselves with a de facto two-tier system – with working people regularly forced to scrape together the means to go private. Meanwhile, over the past 14 years, the ‘winter crisis’ cycle has become part of the national calendar. Every year, a new crisis is declared. Then, every year, the Conservatives reach for a sticking plaster patch-up to get through the winter, without ever addressing the root cause. This is a situation Labour is familiar with: we have saved the NHS before, and the next Labour Government will do so again. With Labour, it will always be publicly owned and publicly funded. But our ambition goes beyond returning the NHS to what it was. Labour’s mission is to build an NHS fit for the future. Investment alone won’t be enough to tackle the problems facing the NHS; it must go hand in hand with fundamental reform. We must change the NHS so that it becomes not just a sickness service, but able to prevent ill heath in the first place. It must also reflect the change in the nature of disease, with a greater focus on the management of chronic, long-term conditions. And we will deliver a renewed drive to tackle the biggest killers; cutting the lives lost to cancer, cardiovascular disease and suicide, while ensuring people live well for longer. Labour’s reforms will shift our NHS away from a model geared towards late diagnosis and treatment, to a model where more services are delivered in local communities. We will harness the power of technologies like AI to transform the speed and accuracy of diagnostic services, saving potentially thousands of lives. And we will embed a greater focus on prevention throughout the entire healthcare system and supporting services. As we knew in 1945, much avoidable ill health can be prevented. The factor that is markedly different from the past decades is our understanding of mental health. Across society, mental health has stepped out of the shadows, yet it is difficult to argue the NHS has kept up. Indeed, Britain is currently suffering from a mental health epidemic that is paralysing lives, particularly those of children and young people. This is a tragedy – arguably nothing says more about the state of a nation than the wellbeing of its children. So right at the core of our mission will be a bold new ambition to raise the healthiest generation of children in our history. And, as a crucial part of that, we will reform the NHS to ensure we give mental health the same attention and focus as physical health.\nLabour will stop the chaos in our health and care services, turn the page, and reform them in line with the principles of the NHS that Labour founded.",

Labour’s new Young Futures hubs will provide open access mental health services for children and young people in every community. Mental health legislation is also woefully out of date. The treatment of people with autism and learning difficulties is a disgrace. The operation of the Mental Health Act discriminates against Black people who are much more likely to be detained than others.

Partying in Downing Street whilst the whole country sacrificed their freedom. Handing lucrative Covid contracts to friends and donors. Failing to expel MPs caught breaking the rules. The behaviour of the Conservatives has understandably led to a widespread belief that many politicians are in it for themselves. As a result, there is now a crisis of confidence in our political system’s ability to deliver any change. This is not limited to Westminster – in Scotland, the Scottish National Party has also failed to uphold the standards expected in public life. The scandals may be different, but the SNP has also sought to protect its own and failed to address the behaviour of its MPs and MSPs, from sexual harassment scandals to accusations of financial mismanagement and defending the inappropriate use of public expenses. The people of Scotland also deserve better from their representatives. It is not just sleaze and scandal that have eroded trust. Just as corrosive has been the inability of politicians to keep promises made to the British people. Over the last 14 years, the vast chasm between Conservative slogans and reality has shown a contempt for democracy. From claiming “we’re all in it together” while decimating public services, to the empty promises to “level up”, gimmicks and gestures have shamefully replaced the hard graft of governing. In contrast, Labour has been transformed from a party of protest to one that always puts the interests of the country first. Now we are determined to do the same with our politics, returning government to the service of working people. This will require a reset in our public life; a clean-up that ensures the highest standards of integrity and honesty. We will make sure MPs focus on serving their constituents. We will deepen our democracy by reforming Parliament and devolving power to communities. And rather than stoking division – as do both the Conservatives and the SNP – we will ensure there is respect and collaboration across the different governments that make up the United Kingdom. Setting the highest of standards in public life is not just about better behaviour or decisionmaking, though it will improve both. It is also central to restoring trust between the public and politics. After 14 years of chaos, division and disrespect, the British people are understandably cynical about appeals to come together in the national interest. But the challenges we face demand nothing less – it is the lifeblood of national renewal. This plan recognises that politics must make the first move in repairing that bond.\nLabour will end the chaos of sleaze and division, turn the page, and reset politics to put it back in the service of working people.",

This includes enforcing restrictions on ministers lobbying for the companies they used to regulate, with meaningful sanctions for breaching the rules. We will give the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Interests the powers to start investigations into misconduct and ensure they have access to the evidence they need. Most MPs work hard to serve their constituents but can be hamstrung by arcane procedures and outdated working practices. Labour will establish a new Modernisation Committee tasked with reforming House of Commons procedures, driving up standards, and improving working practices. The absence of rules on second jobs also means some constituents end up with MPs who spend more time on their second job, or lobbying for outside interests, than on representing them. Therefore, as an initial step, Labour will support an immediate ban on MPs from taking up paid advisory or consultancy roles.

The next Labour government will therefore bring about an immediate modernisation, by introducing legislation to remove the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords. Labour will also introduce a mandatory retirement age. At the end of the Parliament in which a member reaches 80 years of age, they will be required to retire from the House of Lords. Labour will ensure all peers meet the high standards the public expect of them, and we will introduce a new participation requirement as well as strengthening the circumstances in which disgraced members can be removed. We will reform the appointments process to ensure the quality of new appointments and will seek to improve the national and regional balance of the second chamber.

Inclusive Communications: considerations\n2. GCS Accessibility Standards\n3. Resources and Guidance\n\nWe all have a responsibility to create accessible and inclusive communications. In all cases, you should consider with your policy teams how what you are communicating affects different groups – including people who are protected under the Equality Act 2010 – and plan this into your strategy. Equality Act 2010 requires the government to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled people have equal access to information, goods and services. If your communication is about something that will affect disabled people, or they are entitled to know or be included in, you will need to ensure that you have done as much as can be reasonably expected to ensure they can access and respond to the information. This document is aligned with OASIS and will support you to do that.\n\nThe nine protected characteristics in the Equality Act are: age; sex; race; disability; religion or belief; sexual orientation; pregnancy and maternity; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership.

Once you have completed your communications plan, review the objectives again in light of the audience considerations suggested in this document. Think about whether it is worth amending your KPIs and targets to account for your diverse audiences.\n\nAudience Insight\nWith regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty and GCS professional assurance process (for paid for campaigns with a spend over £100k), ensure you consider the following audiences:\n\nOlder people/Retirement (55-75, consider whether you should break this down further\nOlder people/Elderly (76+, consider whether you should break this down further)\nYouth/younger adults (16-24)\nFamilies with children\nFemale/Male/Non-binary\nPeople from ethnic minority backgrounds\nDisabled people or individuals with a long-term health condition (or carers/guardians)\nNeurodivergent audiences (for example, autism, dyslexia)\nPeople of different or no faiths\nLGBT people\nPregnant people\nIntersectional groups (people with multiple characteristics)\n\nFor each group consider:\nDo you particularly need this audience to hear and act upon messages?\nWhat estimated percentage of your audience has this characteristic?\n\nYou may also ask the following questions to challenge yourself on your target audience:\nWho currently uses the policy, service or event your communications relate to?\nWho doesn’t currently use the policy, service or event and is this something your communications aim to change? \nWhat are the motivations and barriers to change (including behavioural) that your campaign can help to address?\nDoes the policy, service or event relate to an area with known inequalities?\n\nStrategy\nWhen planning your strategy, reflect on your audience insight to ensure no parts of your audience are excluded from receiving or engaging with your communications. This may involve providing communications in a variety of formats and ensuring that your audiences will engage with the language and imagery you use.\n\nStrategy considerations include:\n- Proposition and messaging        1. Does your messaging appeal to your target audience(s)?\n2. Do you need to create variants of content to better appeal to subgroups of your target audience?\n- Channels and media        1. What channels do your audiences engage with?\n2. Who does your audience listen to and trust (for example, community or faith leaders, or other intermediaries and influencers)\n3. How have you factored audience demographics into allocation of your media spend?\n4. Remember some audiences will have low or no level of digital engagement or access, or may use digital media differently.\n- Testing        1. Can you set up a focus group/s which reflects your target audiences to consult, discuss, test and seek feedback.\n\nImplementation\nBefore publication, test your content for impact and accessibility before and during its use. Build in ‘pause points’ to your delivery timeline to review impact and gather feedback on its reception.\n\nImplementation considerations include:\n- Language (should be considered upfront):\n1. Does the language inadvertently promote unhelpful stereotypes or inadvertently exclude people?\n2. Is the language used easy to understand? Most users prefer simple language, including specialist audiences.\n3. Have you followed gov.uk’s style guide on how to write about ethnicity, which explains why we do not use the terms BAME and BME?\n- Diverse Imagery (should be considered upfront):\n1. Is your target audience represented in your materials visually, orally and in the contexts and scenarios featured?\n2. Is there a wide variety of people with protected characteristics represented in your materials? \n3. Have you co-created/tested your concepts with people representing your audience? \n4. Do your images inadvertently reinforce stereotypes?\n- Format:\n1. Use the GCS Accessibility Standards (available at https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/publications/inclusive-communications-template/#objectives-1)\n\nScoring\nYou should consider how you will monitor and evaluate the impact of your communications. Where possible, you should demonstrate how planning with the inclusive principles above has affected the impact of your communications, especially where you have engaged audiences you have struggled to in the past. \n\nHow have you ensured your data collection methods are inclusive?\nAre you collecting your data in a way that will allow you to assess how well you have reached and influenced key target audiences and, where appropriate, subgroups of your audience? \nHow have you adapted your strategy if you have seen a lower level of engagement from particular audiences? For example, re-allocating campaign spend to specific community channels/radio stations to increase potential reach.",

Where it says ‘Should be available upfront’ you should ensure your communications meets this requirement by default. Where it says ‘Should be considered upfront’, you should consider as part of your campaign planning.\n\n- Clear print (should be followed upfront):\nClear print is a set of principles which give guidance on producing printed documents in a way which makes them accessible. Departments should adhere to the guidelines such as: \n1. Font size: minimum 12 point, but consider 14 point if audience comprises those with sight impairments\n2. Style: sans serif is generally more accessible; avoid italics and underline; use bold sparingly\n3. Font thickness: avoid the light options\n4. Text alignment: left aligned\n5. Text direction: horizontally\n6. Line spacing: recommended line spacing is 1.2 pt for a standard document; for font sizes greater than 14 pt, 1.5 line spacing would be recommended.\n7. Document structure: include headings for screen readers and ensure page numbers are positioned consistently\n\n- Hyperlinks (should be considered upfront):\nHyperlinks provide links to another source of information such as a website page. \n1. Hyperlinks should be descriptive ( for example, In July, the government published a consultation  on helping savers understand their pension choices)\n2. Generic links do not make sense out of context or tell users where a link will take them. They also do not work for people using screen readers, who often scan through a list of links to navigate a page. It’s important the links are descriptive so they make sense in isolation.\n3. Don’t use full website addresses\n4. Don’t use shortened URLs such as tinyurl\n5. Don’t use phrases such as ‘(click) here’ or ‘find out more’\n\n- Alt text (should be available upfront):\nAlt text provides a textual explanation for the image or graph used, which can be picked up by screenreaders and help visually impaired audiences feel included.\n1. All images, graphics, tables on websites or social media should include alt text. \n\n- Use of colour (should be available upfront):\n1. Using accessible colours to convey messaging (blue, green, yellow)\n2. Follow relevant guidelines on colour combinations and contrasts\n3. Make sure that colour is not the only visual method for conveying information\n4. Check that colours you are using don’t reinforce gender stereotypes\n\n- Imagery and movement (should be available upfront):\n1. Guidance on imagery should be followed.\n2. If producing videos, make sure to avoid flashing lights and photography to which some people are sensitive\n3. Avoid moving images behind text: this can be hard for screen reader users and disabled people\n4. Keep Italics and moving fonts to a minimum\n\n- Captioning on audio-visual content including TV, cinema and online. \nShould be available upfront:\n1. All audio-visual content, including TV and cinema advertising, social and digital content, should be captioned/subtitled.where possible closed (viewer-controlled) captioning is preferred.\n2. Open captioning may present difficulties for those with cognitive impairments. Where closed captioning is not possible, open (embedded) captioning is acceptable\n3. In all cases, follow relevant guidelines on how to caption AV.\n4. Transcripts should also be available. \n\nShould be considered upfront:\n1. Captioning cinema advertising where possible.\n\n- British Sign Language (should be considered upfront):\n1. There is no statutory requirement for all government communications to be translated into BSL. But, all government departments are expected to consider where the use of BSL will be of most interest and importance to Deaf BSL users.\n2. The BSL Act states that BSL should be actively considered for any public announcement on policy or changes to the law, including:\n– publication of plans, strategies, policy and other – consultations and consultation responses\n– press conferences\n– social media\n– websites\n\nAlthough agencies are not in scope of the BSL Act 2022, there is an expectation they will align their communications with the Act. \n\n- Video relay (should be considered upfront):\n1. Think about how deaf, hearing and speech impaired individuals can respond to your communications. \n2. Use Video Relay Services for communicating with people whose first or preferred language is British Sign Language. VRS is available on different platforms so check with your communications teams on which platform is best for you.\n\n- Textphone / Text Relay (should be considered upfront):\n1. Think about how deaf, hearing and speech impaired individuals can respond to your communications. Use text relay for hearing and/or speech impaired individuals. \n\n- Alternative Formats (should be available on demand):\n1. Audio such as audio tapes or digital files (MP3).\n2. Braille\n3. Easy Read\n4. Large Print\n5. Makaton\n\nIt is important to consider formats early in the planning process to ensure you have budgeted, and built in time, for necessary procurement or translation services. As producing alternative formats has cost implications, producing large quantities of alternative formats may be unnecessary and wasteful. Identify, segment and prioritise your audiences, and consider how best to reach them using a mix of formats and channels and factor in costs at the beginning. Conduct research and stakeholder engagement to ensure your approach meets the needs of your intended audience. \n\nNote that where the information is critical to public health, for example COVID-19 or other emergencies, departments should endeavour to make commonly-requested alternative formats available at the same time as other communications. It may be challenging to produce alternative versions of materials at the same time. Departments should continue to engage key stakeholders regularly and ensure initial communications are as accessible as possible. Where alternative formats are required upfront, you should consider committing to producing appropriate formats when circumstances allow, and within a feasible time frame.",

The government must communicate effectively with everyone so that all citizens have access to important information and can engage with the government on issues that will affect them. It is imperative that we understand how policy and communications impact citizens, understand their needs and requirements, and make our communications as inclusive and accessible as possible. \n\nThis guide provides some guidance to help government communicators, policy officials and others provide British Sign Language (BSL) bespoke content, translations and interpretation to those who need it.\n\nBritish Sign Language (BSL) is the most common form of sign language in the UK. It involves a combination of hand shapes and movements, lip patterns, facial expressions and shoulder movements. It has its own grammar and is structured in a completely different way from English.\n\nThe British Sign Language Act 2022 requirement is to report the use and promotion of BSL. There is no statutory requirement for all government communications to be translated into BSL. But, all government departments are expected to consider where the use of BSL will be of most interest and importance to Deaf BSL users. \n\nThe guide is primarily about BSL, but also refers to making communications accessible to those with hearing loss who are not BSL users. It is focused on the use of BSL for communications of policy, changes to legislation and other critically-important information. \n\nThe guide focuses on communicating and engaging primarily with external public audiences rather than in one-to-one situations. While the guide is focused on external audiences, government organisations should also consider the needs of internal BSL users in recruitment, training, and everyday working situations, and make reasonable adjustments where needed. \n\nThis guide is in several parts:\n\nBritish Sign Language Act 2022: An introduction to BSL and the 2022 Act and what it means for government departments.\nKey facts about hearing loss, BSL and the Deaf community.\nCreating bespoke BSL content, translating and interpreting: Guidance on planning communications and engagement with Deaf people who use BSL and those who are hard of hearing.

It officially recognises British Sign Language as a language of Great Britain.\n\nGovernment departments and organisations already create accessible communications, including increasing use of BSL translations, interpreting and bespoke content.\n\nHowever, there is more to do to ensure that government departments and organisations improve the experience of Deaf people when they interact with the government.\n\nNearly all government departments must report on how they are promoting and using BSL in their communications with the public. There are exceptions, such as the Northern Ireland Office. The first BSL report was published on 31 July 2023.\n\nThe act covers England, Scotland and Wales. The act does not extend to Northern Ireland. This is to acknowledge that equality law is devolved in Northern Ireland, and British and Irish Sign Languages are used among the Northern Irish Deaf community.\n\nFor the purposes of the act, only core departments need to report on how they promote and use BSL in their communications. Agencies, non-departmental public bodies and other arm’s length bodies are not in scope of the act, but are encouraged to use BSL translation and interpreting where it meets the needs of audiences, or to produce explanatory material directly in BSL.\n\nThe act specifically covers any public announcement on policy or changes to the law, such as plans, strategies, and policy and other consultations and responses. It also mentions press conferences, social media, and websites.\n\nAn independent BSL Advisory Board will advise the UK government on implementation and represent the Deaf community. \n\nGovernment Communication Service (GCS) is keen to ensure that every department is aware of, and understands, the legal requirements and ensures it complies with the spirit of the act.\n\nGCS is also keen that the government continuously improves its use of BSL and how it meets the needs of Deaf people.",

        "content": "One in five people (12 million) in the UK are Deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nBy 2035, Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) estimates there will be around 14.2 million adults with hearing loss.\n\nMany people with hearing loss will rely on captioning/subtitling to access audio-visual content such as advertisements or social media videos.\n\nHowever, based on official statistics, there are around 150,000 BSL users in total, of whom 87,000 are Deaf. This does not include professional BSL users, interpreters, and translators, unless they use BSL at home. According to RNID, based on census data, there are 25,000 who use BSL as their main language across the UK.\n\nBritish Sign Language has its own vocabulary, grammatical structure and syntax. Its sentence and word order do not replicate spoken English.\n\nDeafness is strongly associated with poor literacy skills. Reading skills of those who are born Deaf are significantly below their hearing peers. The most recent group study of adolescent Deaf readers in the UK (aged 13-14) showed this group has a mean reading age equivalent to that of 10-11 year olds. The lag in reading age increases over time as hearing children progress more rapidly than Deaf children.\n\nFor these reasons, captioning should not be seen as sufficient for all Deaf people.",

BSL is the first or main language and preferred means of communication for many Deaf people, especially those who have been Deaf from birth or early childhood. Deafness is strongly associated with poor literacy skills. \n\nYou should however use captions/subtitling on audio-visual content (such as TV, social media assets) for those who are hard of hearing, but are not BSL users. This may also benefit many people without hearing loss who regularly use subtitles.\n\nWhen captions are used, ensure that they are a large size ideally in white on a solid black background (not transparent) using a dyslexia-friendly font to allow access by people who have visual or reading difficulties.\n\nCaptions should be available as a separate script. The transcript should include a written description of the video action, and be compatible with specialist vision software or Braille readers. Discuss requirements with your supplier. \n\nConsider if a full BSL translation is required for your audience. Are you able to consider an executive and/or summary translation to minimise the risk of a delayed alternative format publication? Audiences should not have to wait for another format to engage with government messaging. \n\nYou may at times, however, need to produce communications quickly in response to unexpected or external circumstances. In these circumstances, it may be challenging to produce translations and alternative versions of materials at the same time. You should continue to engage all your key stakeholders regularly and ensure all your initial communications are as accessible as possible. Where appropriate, for communications critical to your audience, for example on health advice, you should consider committing to producing as a priority BSL, and other appropriate formats when circumstances allow, and within a feasible time frame. Wherever possible, tell your audience when the BSL translation will be available. You may also need to have a plan for interpreting and/or translating urgent communications.\n\nWhen in doubt – the legislation that governs this area of work is the Public Sector Equality Duty, a part of the Equality Act 2010 (section 149) that requires all public bodies to consider the effects of their work on those with protected characteristics (which includes disability) and ensure any proposed approach is not discriminatory. The duty to make reasonable adjustments (section 20) goes further, requiring positive steps to ensure those that have protected characteristics are not put at a disadvantage by the policies or communications we produce. Practically, this means it is our legal duty to consider and take action to ensure accessibility in our communications.",

        "content": "Build into the timelines the need to translate public-facing communications into BSL, ideally to coincide with all other communications. Depending on the length of content, it may take a few weeks at least to produce content.\n\nWork with your commercial team to proactively identify providers of interpreting and translation, and discuss with them timescales for urgent and live communications as part of your requirements. If you have a current provider that cannot provide that service, identify those who can. You will then be ready when you need to provide communications quickly, for example, to procure and provide interpreters in the room for announcements.\n\nEngage with your commercial team early to ensure appropriate procurement/check existing contracts for BSL translators and interpreters.\n\nEnsure that there are quality control checks in place. Make sure the standard of the BSL is of high quality.\n\nEngage suppliers early and assess their capabilities upfront. Check what BSL translations/interpreting they have done before, what quality assurance processes they have in place, whether they sub-contract. \n\nYou should consider your own department’s quality control process, and, where possible, double check translations to ensure you are content with them. \n\nCheck the supplier’s timelines and ensure they are realistic and allow time for stakeholder engagement and internal approvals.\n\nBefore a document can be translated, ensure that it is the final version and in concise language.\n\nOnly use registered and qualified professionals. Some Deaf people are qualified translators but not qualified interpreters. Where possible Deaf translators and interpreters should be considered. \n\nConsider the person specification you need for the professional translator/ interpreter – for example, gender, age range, and ethnicity.\n\nThere are regional variations in BSL. If you’re commissioning interpreting or translation for a specific regional audience, consider commissioning professional interpreters or translators from the area.\n\nFor longer-form or complex content, consider using more than one translator/interpreter. This could be useful for quality control and language monitoring too.\n\nShare approved guidance with translators/interpreters in advance so they can understand the meaning of content, seek clarification, and ensure they translate correctly.\n\nThink about how BSL users can respond to your communications. Use video relay services (VRS) for communicating with people whose first or preferred language is British Sign Language. VRS is available on different platforms so check with your communications teams on which platform is best for you.",

        "name": "Translation from written text to video",
        "content": "Ideally, do user testing for content, comprehension and style. Ensure the user testing reflects the diversity of the audience. Engage with BSL users early. You may wish to identify any BSL users within your department – and the department’s disability network.\n\nEnsure that your visual BSL translations are as accessible as possible to Deaf BSL users with additional disabilities, including those with low vision.\n\nFor bespoke content, and Q&A, you will likely be working with Deaf presenters rather than translators.\n\nTry different styles and formats such as Q&A format, walk-throughs or other bespoke BSL content: don’t just opt for video overlay.\n\nFor example, think about the positioning of the translator on screen, what other graphics and imagery is used in the video – could these be removed? Ensure the focus is on the translated BSL itself. \n\nEnsure the translator is surrounded by a plain background that contrasts with their skin tone. Do not put the translator in front of moving imagery. This reduces the contrast for Deaf people with visual impairments.\n\nEnsure the translator is at a decent size in proportion to the screen.\n\nVisually-impaired signers often rely on a clear silhouette of the signer. It is just as important to have good contrast for all whole body/arm movements as it is to see the hands and face. This often gets forgotten. Avoid putting the translator over moving imagery which is suboptimal access for deafblind people.\n\nEnsure that the translator has a high contrast between their skin tone and clothes. Blues are often better than black or white but you should seek guidance. Background should be plain without any graphics.\n\nRemember that BSL is a different language to English and won’t necessarily synchronise with English. If you are creating a BSL translated video from a standard video, be aware there are technical challenges, including time-matching.\n\nIf you are filming a standard (non-BSL) video and are then creating a BSL translated video with this, make sure you have lots of B-Roll footage. BSL translation will not match the timing of a standard narrated video format. To retain a richness of delivery/engaging translation – the translator needs time to fully explain the spoken English into BSL. The additional B-Roll footage can be used to extend sequences while the translator is fully explaining all the original content. Ensure that when a film with BSL is edited, the edits are checked by a BSL user, translator or interpreter. Contact Steven Gardner, the DWP designer, for more information about this.\n\nIt may be appropriate to use audio narration and captions to complement the BSL signing.\n\nThere is a lack of research or guidelines for ensuring best possible access of Deaf people with visual impairments to BSL video translations.\n\nHowever, the following are commonly requested by deafblind signers with partial sight:\n\nsubtitles, larger size, white on solid black background (not transparent)\ntranslator to have high contrast between skin tone and clothes\nshades of blue are often easier than black or white – for example, navy\nshort sleeves where possible\nbackground to be low glare, not white, royal blue often works well\nplain clothing, no patterns or jewellery\na plain shirt or tee is easier than a shirt and tie with a jacket\nif a shirt, tie and suit has to be worn then they should all be the same colour\nthe translator/interpreter should be as large as possible on the screen\nbackground should be plain without confusing graphics\ntranslator should never be placed over a moving image but in a separate box, this is to retain good contrast for the movements of the translator’s silhouette",

        "content": "The Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) guidance on interpreting says two interpreters will be required for assignments over 1 hour in length. Video or remote interpreting is not suitable for assignments over 40 minutes in length.\n\nBook as early as possible.\n\nProvide as much detail about the content or event as possible.\n\nFind out the name and contact details of your interpreter.\n\nIf interpreting for a meeting, webinar or training session, do factor in breaks. If the event is online, Zoom may be better than MS Teams due to technical issues and functionality. Where possible, ask Deaf users of BSL whether they would prefer that you avoid the extensive use of Chat in written English (or Welsh), which may not be accessible to some BSL users, due to literacy difficulties or having to divide visual attention with BSL conversation and the chat function. If using a presentation, ask the interpreters how you can make sure that Deaf BSL users can see the interpreter. \n\nAt press conferences or other live events, consider the venue set up and interpreter positioning, so the interpreter is clearly visible, and ensure an audio/ video feed is available as needed.\n\nAs with any other language interpreter, remember there will be differences in grammar and sentence structure between the source language and BSL, and so on. The interpreter may not start to sign what you are saying until you are well into your sentence. \n\nSpeak at your normal pace and don’t slow down unnaturally. Interpreters are experts at listening and signing at the same time. If you do go too fast, or they don’t understand something, they will stop you and ask you to repeat. Be aware that when people read from a script, they often speak too fast. If that is the case for you, pause at the end of each sentence to allow the interpreter time to interpret.\n\nBe aware of the time lag, there is often around 20 seconds delay in the translation.\n\nBSL/English Interpreters provide an interpretation of what is being said and not necessarily an exact translation; be aware that misunderstandings and misinterpretations can happen. Where possible, check shared understanding of critical information. ",

        "content": "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) accessibility design team has made great strides in recent years to ensure content is available to its Deaf customers who use British Sign Language.\n\nThe DWP even has its own BSL YouTube channel with over 2,000 subscribers and 166 videos covering topics from individual benefits and entitlements to White Papers.\n\nOne example is the four videos about Disability Living Allowance for children, a benefit that can help with the extra costs of supporting a child with limited mobility or who needs more looking after than a child without disability. The videos have 4,991 views to 30 August 2023. \n\nThe initial BSL project, launched in 2018, following a recommendation from a Ministerial Taskforce on Alternative Formats to improve its BSL offering. Previously the DWP’s\nBSL videos tended to be limited to Green Papers, usually on topics such as disability benefits or reform.\n\nThe team’s initial work focused on reviewing what the department was doing, how it could improve its offering, and what it would take to bring BSL videos in-house. \n\nBen Railton, the DWP Accessible Design team leader says: \n\n“We needed to understand the language and barriers facing BSL users and then implement the format into our team. All of this took time! Our latest projects are significantly quicker thanks to having an established operating model and standards to work to.”\n\nDWP’s BSL videos are now produced largely in-house. This includes script creation, sign off, filming, editing, and all post-production work. The videos are made in a variety of formats, include an audio overlay, and are captioned. The team often uses two translators, especially on longer-form or complex topics, and videos are presented in an informal question-and-answer format.\n\nYou can view the Department for Work and Pensions BSL video – Attendance Allowance, How Do I Apply and When Can I Claim it From? which uses a question and answer format.\n\nThey have sourced translators via NRCPD, the national regulator of language professionals and also used the DWP’s language supplier to provide some BSL footage. Translator fees for each project in this case cost between £500 and £600 each for 2-3 videos on average, but costs depend on length, content complexity, and other factors. Deaf translators should be used wherever possible.\n\nThe DWP has engaged charities such as the British Deaf Association, Royal National Institute for Deaf People, and other partners and stakeholders to support content development and approve the design format for customers. \n\nNative BSL speakers at the DWP also review and suggest improvements to content.\n\nThe DWP team has faced a number of challenges while working on BSL translations and improved their offer:\n\nA work coach in a London-based Jobcentre, and a member of the BSL testing team, says: \n\n“It was great to have the opportunity to test out the new DLA for children’s products. I enjoyed these videos and really like this dialogue style of communicating information, where two Deaf people are having a conversation in BSL about a topic. Involving colleagues like me really helps to make sure we produce the highest quality information products that work well for the audience, it is inclusive and shows when we need to try something different we can adapt what we do to suit our audience’s needs.” \n\nSourcing qualified translators who are content to be filmed (rather than provide live face-to-face interpreting). This was particularly the case before the DWP’s language provider started to provide translations. Many Deaf translators specialise in this type of work.\n\nSharing approved content in advance so the translator can make sure they understand it, seek clarification, and ensure they are translating correctly.\n\nThey have also made a number of changes to improve their BSL content:\n\nThe DWP moved from standard overlay videos to a variety of formats/options evolving to a format ‘that really engages Deaf users’ (British Deaf Association).\nThey are investigating and evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) narrations rather than rely on real person narrators.\nAt times, sourcing a narrator has caused production delays and led to re-takes due to poor quality recordings.\nAs the DWP’s designers don’t speak or fully understand BSL, for any live filming, they use an autocue with a narrated voice over. This audio is picked up by the camera allowing the videographer to know exactly what was being read, and signed by the translator, when the DWP goes into post-production.\nFor more information, see the video presentation on the DWP’s BSL video offer.",

        "name": "Reforming the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) and Alternative Provision (AP) system ",
        "content": "In March 2023, the Department for Education (DfE) published its Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND) and Alternative Provision (AP) Improvement Plan in a range of accessible formats to provide everyone the opportunity to engage and understand the government’s plans. This included British Sign Language (BSL) video translations, with audio and subtitles, Easy Read and, on demand, Braille and other formats.\n\nThis built on the team’s learnings from production of accessible formats for the SEND Review Green Paper consultation (March 2022), which included BSL and Easy-Read. \n\nThe consultation aimed to find out how the SEND and AP system had developed since the reforms were introduced in 2014; and how the system could be improved further to ensure a quality service be delivered consistently across the whole country to meet the needs of children and their families; and the professionals who are working to support them.\n\nTo develop the alternative formats, the department engaged with a range of stakeholders representing children and young people with SEND, and their families, and workforces across education, health and social care. \n\nInsights from stakeholder engagement showed that many operating within the system, including parents and carers, had their own special education needs and as such communications should be simple and jargon free, and available in accessible formats to ensure no-one felt excluded from the messaging or activity.\n\nThe BSL videos, which included audio and subtitles were produced through CCS Language Services (RM6141) framework (Lot 4 – Non-spoken Language Services). \n\nFrom initial planning (onboarding the supplier) to publication of the videos on YouTube and GOV.UK, the entire process can take between 4 – 16 weeks, depending on the size of the document. Translating a 30,000 word consultation document, including audio and subtitling, can cost between £30,000 and £36,000 excluding VAT. For something smaller, such as an Executive Summary with a 4,000 word count, costs will likely be around £4,000 excluding VAT.\n\nFor the improvement plan BSL translation, the team applied learnings from the green paper translation, reformatting the document to speed up subtitle editing later in the process, agreeing pronunciations with the voiceover artist before recording. All of which helped to produce the final translation to time, and achieved value for money.\n\nThe BSL videos for the green paper consultation received over 500 views during launch, helping to achieve a total of around 6,000 responses to the consultation, from parents and carers, children and young people, and those working across education, health and care and local government. The videos on the improvement plan received over 800 views during launch. \n\nLauren Ashton, strategic communications lead for the SEND and AP Improvement Plan says: \n\n“Stakeholders responded positively to provision of the accessible formats, including BSL translations particularly when we were able to publish them on the same day of the announcement of the improvement plan.”\n\nWhen producing alternative formats, consider:\n\nOnboarding suppliers early and assess their capabilities upfront – are their timelines realistic, have they produced BSL before, do they sub-contract, what’s their quality assurance process.\nConsider if a full BSL translation is required for your audience – government processes often lead to last-minute policy changes. Are you able to consider an executive summary translation to minimise the risk of a delayed alternative format publication? Audiences should not have to wait for another format to engage with government messaging. \nTake an audience-first approach – don’t assume a straight translation of the document will create the best experience for the person watching the content. For example, written documents often include formatting such as paragraph numbers, and tables. Work with your supplier to determine the right version to translate, or better yet, reach out to those with first-hand experience. Consider working with your department’s disability network or trusted stakeholder alongside your supplier to ensure your content is fit for purpose.",
