In this guide, you will find out how to apply a behavioural approach to campaign design and implementation to maximise the effectiveness of your campaign.\n\nBehavioural science gives us the tools to analyse the context, empathise with target audiences, and ensure that the campaign helps enable behaviours. This guide will showcase the principles of behavioural change communications, providing theories and techniques to embed throughout a campaign in order to optimise its outcomes.\n\nFollowing the success of the previous GCS guidance titled “Strategic Communications: a behavioural approach” and the demand for a more in-depth look into behavioural science for communicators, this guide expands on the previous content and provides practical tools and case studies to further support the application of behavioural science to communication activities.\n\n**How to use this guide**\nThroughout this guide, we will illustrate theory with case studies from the UK and international governments. We will also work through a fictional example campaign aimed at closing the gender gap in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) field.\n\nFor particularly complex campaigns, we recommend seeking advice from behavioural scientists during the campaign development process.

        "name": "Objective setting: Understanding the policy aims",
        "content": "One of the first steps in planning a campaign is setting campaign objectives. The communications objectives will need to be derived from a policy objective. The policy objective will always drive the campaign but, in order to achieve it, a combination of policy and communications objectives will need to be met along the way.\n\nExample\nYour objective could be “to increase engagement in sustainable behaviours”. The starting point is specifying what is meant by ‘sustainable behaviours’ and ‘engagement’. It could be that the focus of the policy is mainly on behaviours associated with energy use and that the definition of engagement will depend on the specific behaviour, for example installing solar panels or improving home insulation.\n\nHere are some questions you may want to ask policy colleagues to understand the predetermined objective first:\n\nHow was the policy objective selected?\nWhat is the wider intent and strategic context of the objective?\nAre there any other objectives or goals that might conflict with it? If so, what are the trade-offs?\nIs the stated objective based on what the decision-maker wants to see achieved, or an assumption about what the means to achieve it are (for example, a campaign)?\nWhat relevant evidence is available?\nIs there an existing user journey?",

        "name": "Objective setting: Defining the problem and key actors in the system",
        "content": "The next step in designing a campaign involves examining the current situation (meaning what is currently happening, what behaviours are we seeing) and defining what about it needs to change or happen as a result of the campaign.\n\nDefining the problem also includes identifying the relevant ‘actors’ who are involved in behaviours relevant to the problem, which should help to identify the correct audience for your campaign.\n\nFor example, a campaign that aims to encourage children to eat more fruit may appear to address the problem that “children do not choose to eat fruit at school.” However, the actual problem may be that schools do not offer an affordable selection of fruit. In this case, schools may be a more suitable target for a campaign, as schools are the actor with the most influence on the outcome of interest.\n\nIn many cases, the “problem” may be obvious and require little further examination.\n\nFor example, a campaign that aims to reduce the use of single-use plastics addresses the obvious problem that too much non-biodegradable plastic waste is produced.\n\nIn other cases the problem may be less straightforward and could require exploring existing research or commissioning of new research in order to ensure that the problem is well understood, and that the relevant actors are identified.\n\nFor example, a campaign that aims to encourage people to apply to a university could aim to address the problem that there is a low number of applicants or the problem that certain demographic groups are overrepresented among applicants. Each problem would require a different communications approach.\n\nExample 1: Problem diagnosis – identifying when the gender STEM gap first emerges\nIt is well documented that more men than women are in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) profession than women. Any campaign, needs to therefore reduce the gap between the number of men and the number of women in STEM fields. To fully understand this problem and identify where the campaign will be most effective, we need to understand when this gap first appears.\n\nIf we chose a point that is too late, the decision-making points for careers or necessary courses for pursuing STEM careers might have already passed. If we chose a point too early, the effects of the campaign might have ‘worn off’ by the time someone makes decisions that steer them towards STEM careers.\n\nTo ensure we chose the right age group, we can examine relevant literature to find out when the STEM gap starts to appear. Using desk research, we explored findings from a systematic review of the STEM gap in Europe conducted by Microsoft (see reference 1). The review shows that girls in Europe tend to lose interest in STEM around age 15. Therefore, a campaign that encourages uptake of STEM for children aged 5, or 25, is unlikely to have the desired effect.\n\nSchool age children in the UK choose their A-level subjects around the age of 15. An analysis of A-level subject uptake split by gender conducted by Cambridge Assessment (see reference 2) (an exam board in the UK) shows that there is a gap in the choices of STEM subjects. Boys are approximately three times more likely to take physics and twice as likely to take maths and computing. This suggests that A-level choice is a key decision-making point in the closure of the STEM gap.\n\nWe can use this data (amongst others) to diagnose our problem; that girls tend to lose interest in STEM around the age of 15, and that A-level choices is a key point that widens the STEM gap in the UK. We can conclude that any campaign should focus on increasing the number of girls taking STEM subjects at A-level.\n\nGiven the context of the problem and the fact children cannot choose what they are taught, we can conclude that relevant actors in solving this problem are likely to be the child’s parents and teachers.\n\n",

        "name": "Objective setting: Mapping out behaviours with user journeys",
        "content": "Mapping out behaviours involves firstly identifying the key actions that the intended campaign audience needs to take in order to meet the policy objective. These actions can then be organised in the right order, recognising any interdependencies and connections between them, to create a user journey.\n\nIt is also a good idea to consider any actions required from others and incorporate them into the journey. This helps to see the full journey from the audience’s point of view and enables defining the target behaviours the campaign should focus on.\n\nThinking about how the audience interacts with their environment, and thus a campaign, could uncover potentially incorrect assumptions about how the audience will respond to communications.\n\nUser journeys serve as a necessary basis for creating a Theory of Change which will be covered later in the guide.\n\nExample 2: Campaign to encourage STEM A-level subject uptake in girls\nThe first diagram depicts the user journey a school girl might go through when choosing STEM A-level subjects. It is likely that they will choose STEM subjects if they perceive science as for them, and find science lessons enjoyable and engaging. They may also complete extracurricular activities that further fuel their interest in science, such as reading books or watching documentaries. Each of these behaviours might have barriers attached to it, that we can overcome with different strands of our campaign.\n\nThis diagram shows six steps a school girl might need to take before she chooses STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) A-level subjects: 1) Attend school and learn about science, 2) Express interest in science, 3) Complete extra curricular activities about science, 4) Perceive science as something enjoyable and interesting, 5) Consider options and interest, 6) Choose STEM A-level subjects.\nDiagram 1: user journey of a school girl. Click on the image for a larger format.\nHowever, targeting the child might not be enough. When diagnosing the problem, we identified that because the child doesn’t have much decision-making power about what they are taught, other people surrounding the child may have to perform some behaviours for the campaign to be successful. We can then expand on the current user journey and create a map that shows the interactions required by the different actors in this scenario to help the child perform the behaviours in their user journey. An example of the behaviours required by the teachers and parents of the child are provided in the diagram 2 below.\n\nThis diagram shows the interaction between the steps a schoolgirl might need to take before she chooses STEM A-level subjects (the same as in diagram 1) and actions of a parent and a teacher.\n\nThe four actions of a parent are: 1) Parental expectation of child not restricted by gender, 2) Talk to the child about their interest in science, 3) Provide activities or resources about science, 4) Encourage child to perceive science positively.\n\nThe four actions of a teacher are: 1) Create engaging and inclusive science lessons, 2) Provide feedback at parent/teacher events, 3) Make suggestions for/provide extra curricular activities, 4) Provide advice on A-level choices to pursue.\nDiagram 2: user journey of a school girl, parent and teacher. Click on the image for a larger format.\nAs shown in the diagram 2 above, in order for children to learn about science, teachers need to create engaging and inclusive science lessons, which means they need to ask questions and demonstrate that science is a subject suited to both boys and girls.\n\nIf the campaign exclusively focuses on girls as an audience, then it is likely to be less effective if one of the desired behaviours relies on the actions of the teacher or parents.",

Some of these behaviours will help to meet the policy aim, but do not give defined, measurable outcomes to be tested against the objective.\n\nThe second option is better as it includes a discrete observable action that one can measure, for example number of girls choosing science subjects for A-level, and one that contributes to the likelihood of closing the gender STEM gap.",

        "name": "Understanding your audience: Understanding barriers to behaviour change using the COM-B model",
        "content": "According to the COM-B model, in order to do a behaviour an individual must have the Capability to do it, the Motivation to do it, and external factors must provide the individual with an Opportunity to do it (see reference 3).\n\nCapability\nCapability is defined as an individual’s psychological and physical capacity to engage in the activity concerned (see reference 3). In communications, it typically refers to the audience having the awareness, knowledge, and skills to enact the intended behaviour.\n\nA “capability barrier” occurs when a person cannot enact a behaviour due to not possessing the necessary awareness, knowledge, or skills. Campaigns that intend to encourage behaviour change by promoting awareness or providing educational information will typically be aiming to address capability barriers.\n\nGenerally, capability barriers may be the easiest to address using communications – it feels like the natural job of communications to inform and educate audiences.\n\nTo find capability barriers to the desired behaviour, these questions may be helpful:\n\nIs the audience aware of the issue or the need to change behaviour?\nDoes the audience have the right knowledge to do it?\nDoes the audience have the right skills to do it?\nIs the audience physically and mentally able to do it?\nMotivation\nMotivation is defined as “all those brain processes that energize and direct behaviour, not just goals and conscious decision-making…[including] habitual processes, emotional responding, as well as analytical decision-making” (see reference 3). It is helpful to think of motivation as the beliefs and attitudes that drive enthusiasm, or lack of it, to enact a behaviour.\n\nA “motivation barrier” occurs when a person does not enact a behaviour due to not wanting to do it, or not believing that they should do it. Campaigns that intend to encourage behaviour change by evoking emotion, highlighting risks of inaction, or changing opinion about the importance of a behaviour will typically be aiming to address motivation barriers.\n\nHabit is also a determinant of motivation, in the sense that if someone habitually enacts a behaviour, they are unlikely to require much further motivation to continue to do so. So if habits are firmly in place among the target audience in line with the target behaviour, they are unlikely to face motivation barriers to that behaviour. If the audience has other habits that might make it more difficult to enact the desired behaviour, then this may negatively impact motivation.\n\nMotivation barriers can be addressed using communications, to encourage people to change their beliefs or attitudes towards a behaviour.\nTo find motivation barriers to a desired behaviour, these questions may be helpful:\n\nDoes the audience believe they should do it?\nDoes the audience want to do it?\nDoes the audience have habits in place to support it?\nOpportunity\nOpportunity is defined as “all the factors that lie outside the individual that make the behaviour possible or prompt it” (see reference 3). In practice, this will refer to things like having the time, resources, tools, money, and access to enact the desired behaviour.\n\nAn “opportunity barrier” occurs when a person does not enact a behaviour due to something outside their control – for example, lacking the money to pay a fee for a service, or lacking access to a computer to use an online tool.\n\nTypically, communications alone cannot easily address opportunity barriers, as these sit outside the control of the audience. This is why it is particularly important to explore opportunity barriers, as a campaign alone will not be sufficient to remove these barriers and drive behaviour change.\n\nTo find opportunity barriers to the desired behaviour, these questions may be helpful:\n\nDoes the audience have the resources to do it?\nWill the system or environment allow the audience to do it?\nWill the audience’s social and physical environment help or hinder them in doing it?",
    },
    {
        "name": "Understanding your audience: Removing opportunity barriers: options for communicators",
        "content": "While communications cannot easily address opportunity barriers, there are two ways that communicators may be able to adapt campaigns to remove these barriers in other ways.\n\nShifting the target behaviour\nIt may be possible to remove opportunity barriers by changing the target behaviour of the campaign. For example, if a campaign aims to encourage park users to throw their litter away correctly, the audience may face the opportunity barrier that there is no nearby bin. A campaign could instead aim to encourage park users to take their litter home with them, removing this opportunity barrier.\n\nShifting the target audience\nSome opportunity barriers may be caused to capability or motivation barriers faced by people outside the target audience, which communications could then target.\n\nFor example, if a campaign intended to encourage children to eat more fruit at school, the children may face an opportunity barrier of there being no fruit available – which cannot be addressed by a campaign. However, this opportunity barrier (lack of fruit) may be caused by lack of motivation from a headteacher to provide fruit.\n\nMotivation barriers can be addressed by communications, therefore the campaign could instead aim to motivate headteachers to provide fruit at school.",

    {
        "name": "Understanding your audience: Applying COM-B in practice",
        "content": "Once the objective of a campaign is defined, the next step is to identify which barriers the audience might face. The COM-B model can be used to provide useful structure and prompting for this exercise.\n\nThis task requires communicators to put themselves firmly in the shoes of the target audience, and try to view the world from the audience’s perspective. What might stop the audience acting? What difficulties and pressures might they face?\n\nMake sure that you consider barriers across all three COM-B categories – Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation.\n\nQuestions to prompt “Capability” barriers\n\nIs the audience aware of the issue or the need to change behaviour?\nDoes the audience have the right knowledge to do it?\nDoes the audience have the right skills to do it?\nIs the audience physically and mentally able to do it?\nQuestions to prompt “Motivation” barriers\n\nDoes the audience believe they should do it?\nDoes the audience want to do it?\nDoes the audience have habits in place to support it?\nAre there any consequences if my audience doesn’t do it?\nQuestions to prompt “Opportunity” barriers\n\nDoes the audience have the resources (time, money, access, tools) to do it?\nWill the system or environment allow the audience to do it?\nWill the audience’s social and physical environment help or hinder them in doing it?\nThese questions should help communicators produce a long list of barriers that might prevent a person changing their behaviour in the way that the campaign intends.\n\nAt this stage, the list can be long, and you can make some guesses and assumptions.\n\nFurther barriers can be identified using:\n\nExisting research\nNew research, particularly if it is an unusual subject or a hard-to-reach audience\nThird-party research or other published findings\nUser research with members of the target audience\nGathering views from colleagues and stakeholders\nExample 4: Campaign to encourage girls to take up STEM subjects at school\nAs a girl choosing my A-level subjects, I might not choose STEM subjects because…\n\nCapability (awareness and knowledge)\n\nI don’t know what STEM careers are available\nI don’t know what it involves\nOpportunity (resources and processes)\n\nThe lessons clash with creative or language subjects that I want to study\nThe lessons move too fast for me as many classmates have prior knowledge\nMotivation (beliefs and attitudes)\n\nNone of my friends are doing it and I don’t want to be on my own\nI think the lessons will be boring\nI don’t think I would be good at it\nThe next step is to use research and evidence to validate the hypothesised barriers, and to work out which barriers are likely to be the most significant and widespread.\n\nThis can be achieved using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, including polling of the target audience, structured interviews, and focus groups.\n\nThe outcome of this step should be a refined list of barriers categorised under the COM-B categories, and communicators should have a clear idea of which of the identified barriers are likely to pose the most significant obstacles to behaviour change.\n\nIn our worked example 5 below, imagine that we have conducted interviews and polling with girls choosing their A-level subjects, and have identified the barriers marked with an asterisk as the most significant.\n\nExample 5: Campaign to encourage girls to take up STEM subjects at school\nAs a girl choosing my A-level subjects, I might not choose STEM subjects because…\n\nCapability (awareness and knowledge)\n\nI don’t know what STEM careers are available\n*I don’t know what it involves\nOpportunity (resources and processes)\n\nThe lessons clash with creative or language subjects that I want to study\n*The lessons move too fast for me as many classmates have prior knowledge\nMotivation (beliefs and attitudes)\n\nNone of my friends are doing it and I don’t want to be on my own\n*I think the lessons will be boring\n*I don’t think I would be good at it\nThe final step is to determine which barriers can be influenced by a communications campaign, and which will require other policy interventions.\n\nAs a general rule, communications can typically only influence capability and motivation barriers. Opportunity barriers (resources and processes) are unlikely to be influenced by a communications campaign. In other words, a campaign can address knowledge and understanding (capability) and beliefs and attitudes (motivation) but cannot typically address a lack of resources, tools, or money, or access.\n\nIf the analysis has identified significant opportunity barriers to behaviour change, then it is possible that a campaign may not be effective in changing behaviour. If the audience will face significant opportunity barriers, then it may be useful to explore what interventions or changes could remove these barriers.\n\nThe final product should be a list of confirmed barriers to behaviour change that can be effectively addressed by a campaign.\n\nCase Study 2: Modern Slavery\nThere are approximately 10-13,000 potential victims of modern slavery in the UK. In 2019, following an audit of existing communications, the National Security Communications Team (NSCT) within the Cabinet Office identified a need for communications activity to prevent and protect individuals at risk of modern slavery.\n\nInitial campaign objectives were:\n\nReduce the number of people who are forced into modern slavery in the UK by informing them and the community of modern slavery risks and signposting them to the Modern Slavery Helpline.\nIncrease reporting of suspected modern slavery among frontline staff.\nIncrease understanding of the issue of modern slavery among the UK public.\nProblem diagnosis revealed that that frontline professionals provided key touchpoints for victims of modern slavery, and were more likely to come into contact with victims on a regular basis. Three priority sectors identified were banking, healthcare, and recruitment. The campaign focused on the ‘empowered bystanders’ as the primary audience. Individuals working in these roles were interviewed to identify what barriers they felt were present in preventing them reporting a case of modern slavery. Details of the barriers are provided below.\n\nCapability (awareness and knowledge)\n\nAble to spot signs but not necessarily making the connection to modern slavery\nNot in the front of their minds to spot\nFeels distant and not something they have considered\nReporting mechanisms unclear\nOpportunity (resources and processes)\n\nTime pressured jobs\nSome professionals are not allowed to use their phones whilst on duty\nMotivation (beliefs and attitudes)\n\nFear of getting it wrong, feel like they need comprehensive evidence\nDon’t want to look like they are stereotyping\nDon’t always feel like it is their place to be involved in other’s business\nCommunications cannot overcome the identified opportunity barriers as they cannot give people more time in their day to day work, or overcome company policy which does not allow phones to be used. However, the campaign can address capability and motivational barriers by creating transparency around reporting mechanisms, and reassuring people that they are doing the right thing when they are reporting.\n\nAs a result of this COM-B analysis, a key behaviour change was identified. Most professionals were aware of the signs, but did not feel empowered enough to act on said suspicions by phoning the help line. The campaign therefore aimed to get these frontline professionals to look out for, and feel comfortable reporting, incidents of modern slavery by phoning the Modern Slavery Helpline.\n\nA key channel used to reach frontline professionals was out-of-home billboards in high footfall areas across transport hubs. A digital-on approach was taken with advertising on Facebook and Instagram, as well as a bespoke Spotify advert for three music genres. This helped reach audiences at multiple stages throughout their commute and during their usual working day.\n\nSector-specific campaign materials were made for each profession of the signs to look for, allowing them to identify themselves in the campaign and therefore recognise their role in the prevention of modern slavery. The language used informed frontline professionals what they should look out for and reassured participants that it would be doing the right thing to do.\n\nAs a result, frontline professionals said they felt better equipped to identify modern slavery in day-to-day work, and recognised that the campaign was helping them to spot a difficult type of vulnerability to categorise. The campaign evaluation additionally found that the behavioural change objective was achieved. Evidence from the Prime Minister’s Implementation Unit revealed that a significant and meaningful change in the volume of referrals to the helpline was directly attributable to the campaign. Evaluation of the London-specific phase showed that 234 referrals can be directly attributed to the campaign, totalling 507 potential victims lifted out of exploitation since the launch.",

        "name": "Understanding your audience: Articulating your assumptions about behaviour",
        "content": "Assumptions are thoughts about other people or things accepted without having the evidence to know they are true. They are formed by individual beliefs and values, professional experience, organisational values, and influenced by particular intellectual traditions and analytical perspectives. Assumptions range from ideas around the context, the drivers of change, the cause-effect relationships between interventions, outcomes and context, as well as individual and organisational values.\n\nFor example, when developing a campaign tackling smoking cigarettes, it might be an assumption that smokers are not aware of the poor health outcomes associated with smoking, and design a campaign to address the assumed knowledge gap. But what if this assumption is not true? The target audience may smoke in order to break up their working day or socialise with their friends while out, despite being aware of the negative effects on their health.\n\nDespite the risk associated with making assumptions, articulating them is often a necessary first step to finding out what is truly driving or preventing a behaviour. Identifying your assumptions early on in the campaign development process means they can be explored to make sure the campaign is not based on assumptions that are not supported or not fully supported.\n\nAssumptions can be tested either through primary research (for example, commissioning a survey, conducting focus groups or interviews) or by appraising academic evidence in a literature review. Evidence can be used to check and challenge specific assumptions, unearth new ideas and concepts, broaden the range of strategic options that may be relevant for the context, and strengthen their quality to provide a confident basis for action.\n\nExample 6: Assumptions about gender and STEM\nThe list below shows examples of potential assumptions that could be made about gender and STEM. It also shows selected pieces of evidence, which either support or don’t support the assumption.\n\nPlease note the evidence examples used below were selected for illustrative purposes only and do not substitute for a review of available evidence.\n\nAssumption: Most women are not interested in STEM.\n\nEvidence example: 42% of girls surveyed by Microsoft would consider a STEM-related career (see reference 1) – assumption supported\nAssumption: Having great math skills makes girls more likely to obtain a science degree.\n\nEvidence example: Girls with high math skills but little interest in a STEM career are less likely to pursue a science degree than those with average math skills and high interest in science (see reference 4) – assumption not fully supported\nAssumption: Females with successful STEM careers can act as influential messengers\n\nEvidence example: Research has shown that female role models can positively influence women’s attitudes toward STEM careers (see references 5 and 6) – assumption supported\nAssumption: Parents have a role in encouraging STEM uptake in women and girls.\n\nEvidence example: Parents who believe that boys find math more useful and important than girls were found to rate their sons’ math ability higher than daughters’ math ability. These beliefs were positively associated with children’s own perceptions of their ability (see references 7 and 8) – assumption supported\nAssumption: Studying STEM subjects is desirable because it increases employment prospects compared to HSS (arts, humanities and social science).\n\nEvidence example: The 2017 Labour Force Survey shows that 88% of HSS graduates and 89% of STEM graduates were employed in that year (see reference 9) – assumption not supported\nConclusion:\n\nWhilst some of the above assumptions are supported by evidence, the assumption that taking STEM subjects increases employment prospects is not. We should therefore be careful not to use this assumption to inform our campaign, as it will not increase the likelihood of behaviour change.",

        "content": "Strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve an overarching goal. When creating a good communication strategy it is important not only to consider how the planned communication activities will help overcome barriers to behaviour change but also whether there may be any unintended consequences that should be considered as part of the strategy.",

    {
        "name": "Strategy: Unintended consequences",
        "content": "What are unintended consequences?\nUnintended consequences can be described as outcomes of a campaign that are not intended or foreseen. Sometimes these consequences can be positive, such as campaigns that aim to increase physical health having a positive spillover effect on mental health. However, unintended consequences can lead to adverse impacts which may undermine the overall success of the campaign. Unintended consequences can present themselves in many different ways, and this section will take you through a few examples.\n\nTarget Audience Behaviours\nThis occurs when the target audience adopts a behaviour that the campaign did not promote. For example, you may run a campaign to reduce the number of fizzy drinks young people consume to improve their dental health. Campaign evaluation shows a reduction in the number of fizzy drinks purchased by young people. However, there is an increase in drinks that have a high fat content, such as milkshakes. This may improve dental health but have an adverse effect on other health outcomes, leading to a mixed and unpredictable impact on overall health.\n\nOther audience behaviours\nThis occurs when a campaign leads to unintended behaviours from actors outside the target audience. For example, a campaign designed to stop young people from binge drinking might show a group of people at a house party drinking copiously, with a warning about the health risks. However, such a campaign may unwittingly make such a scenario look appealing or exciting, leading some of the target audience to view binge drinking in a positive light and undermining the success of the campaign (see reference 10).\n\nUnintended outcomes\nThis occurs when the target audience performs the behaviour you ask them to, but in doing so falls victim to adverse outcomes. For example, you may run a campaign to reduce air pollution in a city by encouraging people to cycle to work. However, if safety measures (such as road safety training or protective equipment) are not in place, an unintended outcome might be more road traffic accidents involving cyclists.\n\nOperational consequences\nThis occurs when a campaign creates additional or unexpected demand on an organisation or support services, leading to knock-on effects on operational delivery. For example, a campaign may launch to alert people to a new travel pass. If the instructions to obtain this pass are unclear or difficult to understand, audiences may choose to telephone a service centre for help, which may not be equipped or resourced sufficiently to cope with the additional demand.\n\nCase study 3: ban the box campaign\n‘Ban the Box’ was an initiative in the US aimed to reduce the influence of criminal records on hiring practices, and increase the employment prospects of those that had just left prison to prevent re-offending. However, the absence of this information led hiring managers to make assumptions based on the characteristics of the applicant and who they expected to have a criminal record. The campaign did not consider the perspective of employers on hiring ex-offenders. As an unintended consequence, this campaign led to a reduction in the employment prospects of Black and Hispanic men (see reference 11).\n\nExample 7: Gender and STEM – gender and reading?\nImagine that as a result of the time we dedicated to overcoming barriers and designing behaviourally relevant solutions to them, we have increased the number of females taking STEM subjects to A-Level. However, let’s say we revisit this age cohort in a few years to see if the campaign has lasting effects. We find that there are still far more men than women in STEM related careers. What could have happened? Was our campaign a failure?\n\nExamining potential unintended consequences might help to find out. It has been documented that in more gender equal societies, girls and boys perform about the same in maths, but girls are much better at reading than boys (see reference 12). This means that in such societies, girls have the option of going into both STEM-related fields, such as engineering, and reading-related fields, such as law (see reference 13). Boys however, can only pursue STEM related subjects, so the gap will likely persist. Therefore, we didn’t acknowledge that the STEM gap was partially accounted for by a reading gap, leading to a reduction in choice for one gender but not another.\n\nIf we were to re-do the campaign, we might therefore add a strand that explores gender and reading, and then removes barriers for boys pursuing more arts-based careers alongside gender and STEM.\n\nHow can I reduce unintended consequences?\nGiven the complexity of many government policies and, by extension, campaigns it is difficult to predict and identify all possible consequences. However, the following tools can help you uncover and mitigate some potential consequences.\n\nUser journey mapping can uncover hidden steps that your audience may have to go through in order to achieve the required behaviour change, this helps to design communications to address each behavioural change so your audience does not fill in the gaps themselves.\nIdentifying barriers using COM-B allows you to understand what will contribute to your audience(s) making decisions or enacting behaviours. Having a full understanding of this means you can systematically remove barriers to behaviour rather than have some remaining and contributing to unintended consequences.\nCarrying out research and ethnography means you can directly engage with the audience of your campaign, understand what their lives are like, and how they make meaning from different behaviours in the world. Speaking to a diverse group of your target population will give you an understanding of how they would act in response to your campaigns to avoid unintended behaviours.\nArticulating your assumptions using theory of change is a powerful tool for mitigating unintended consequences and being explicit about how your campaign will work. You can articulate potential risks and how you will monitor them, and mitigate their impact.",

        "name": "Strategy: Theory of change",
        "content": "One of the most effective things you can do to avoid unintended consequences is to map all of the planned communications activity and assumptions using a theory of change.\n\nA theory of change is a method used to illustrate how and why behaviour change is expected to happen in a particular context. It maps out all of the factors that will influence an individual’s or organisation’s likelihood of undertaking a particular behaviour.\n\nThis technique allows you to articulate the parameters of your campaign, by distinguishing the role of opportunity barriers in preventing behaviour change. It also allows you to understand the context in which your campaign is operating in, to set realistic expectations about how people will behave.\n\nWe can construct a theory of change using COM-B and a user journey, as outlined in the template diagram below. In this map, all of the behaviours our audiences are expected to do, and their respective barriers, are made explicit. This allows our assumptions about how the campaign will work to be transparent, and be tested with stakeholders and the audience.\n\nThis diagram maps out different types of barriers (capability, motivation, opportunity) and identifies decision-making factors, factors beyond control of communications, and communications levers. \nDiagram 3: Theory of Change. Click on the image for a larger format.\nMapping the interactions between barriers to each behaviour additionally means that evaluation questions can be assigned to each barrier, thus enabling the communicator to track which barriers are most prominent, and which are being overcome by the campaign. The campaign’s strategy can therefore be adapted to the changing needs of the audience, increasing the likelihood of behaviour change.\n\nExample 8: Women in STEM\nNow that we have constructed our user journey and identified COM-B barriers, we can combine these into a theory of change, assigning each barrier to a behaviour on our journey and mapping how barriers influence each step in the journey.\n\nWe start with the journey for the child constructed earlier in this guide:\n\nThis diagram shows six steps a school girl might need to take before she chooses STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) A-level subjects: 1) Attend school and learn about science, 2) Express interest in science, 3) Complete extra curricular activities about science, 4) Perceive science as something enjoyable and interesting, 5) Consider options and interest, 6) Choose STEM A-level subjects.\nDiagram 4: user journey of a school girl. Click on the image for a larger format.\nWe then add the barriers we have identified for the behaviour of ‘Choose STEM subjects at A-Level’. Capability is shown in green, opportunity in purple, and motivation in orange.\n\nThis diagram shows shows the steps a school girl might need to take before she chooses STEM A-level subjects. It shows four specific barriers identified for the last step “Choose STEM subjects at A-level”: 1) I think the lessons will be boring, 2) I don’t think I will be good at it, 3) The lessons clash with creative or language subjects I want to study, 4) I don’t know what STEM A-levels involves.\nDiagram 5. Click on the image for a larger format.\nThis process can be repeated for the other behaviours in the user journey to understand how barriers earlier in the process can lead to a reduction in behaviours change later in the user journey.\n\nWe can do this for all the audiences and behaviours identified in our campaign to create an overall theory of how we think the campaign will work. We can use this framework as a basis for multi-stranded strategies and making sure different audiences targeted in the campaign complement each other. We can also use this framework to design evaluation questions to see which parts of our campaign are working, and which need adapting.\n\nThis diagram shows shows the steps a school girl might need to take before she chooses STEM A-level subjects. It shows four specific barriers identified for the last step “Choose STEM subjects at A-level”: 1) I think the lessons will be boring, 2) I don’t think I will be good at it, 3) The lessons clash with creative or language subjects I want to study, 4) I don’t know what STEM A-levels involves. It also shows five barriers for the third step “Complete extra curricular activities about science”: 1) I’m worried that I’ll get teased for doing science activities, 2) I think the activities will be too difficult, 3) The available activities are too expensive, 4) I don’t know what activities are available in my area.\nDiagram 6. Click on the image for a larger format.\nCase study 4: EU Exit transition campaign\nThis example is a particularly complex Theory of Change, to illustrate how this approach can successfully be applied to large-scale campaigns.\n\nThis diagram shows a particularly complex example of a theory of change. It shows how different capability, opportunity, and motivation factors interact with each other and impact three behaviours leading to businesses taking action to prepare for EU Exit.\nDiagram 7. Click on the image for a larger format.\nBusinesses were an important audience for the EU transition campaign, as their preparation and state of readiness were essential in a smooth departure from the EU on 31 December 2020.\n\nTo ensure we understood the cognitive challenge faced by businesses before the campaign launched, we developed the EU Transition Theory of Change. As the campaign consists of many actions required of a vast and varied audience, the theory of change had to match the complexity of the campaign. This theory of change consists of a map of the decision-making journey an individual must take between seeing a “Get ready for Brexit” message and taking action (pink boxes at the bottom of the diagram). According to the COM-B framework, each decision in this journey is influenced by capability, motivation, and opportunity barriers. Capability and motivation barriers can be influenced by communications (blue). The theory of change also maps out the risks of the campaign (green), and which factors are outside of the campaign’s control (orange).",

        "name": "Strategy: Campaign generated inequalities",
        "content": "What are campaign generated inequalities?\nCampaign-generated inequalities occur when a campaign disproportionately benefits those who are already advantaged in society. A campaign may be successful at achieving the desired behaviour change across the population as a whole, while still increasing inequality due to having different impacts on different groups.\n\nFor example, a campaign to reduce smoking may have overall success, with a 20% reduction in the number of smokers across the population. However, a closer look at the data may reveal that the campaign had inequitable impacts. For example, a 40% reduction in smoking in the wealthiest areas but only a 5% reduction in smoking in the most disadvantaged areas. As a result, the campaign may not have had much of an impact on the audience that would benefit most from behaviour change. Inequalities like this can occur if part of the target audience are less able to access a campaign, understand it, and subsequently engage with it (see reference 14).\n\nCampaign generated inequalities typically fall into three categories:\n\nInequality in access occurs when the intervention is delivered through channels that are primarily used by only part of the audience. For example, if a campaign is delivered exclusively through digital channels such as Facebook and Spotify, those that lack reliable internet access or a smartphone will be unlikely to see your campaign.\nInequality in uptake occurs when there are significant opportunity barriers to enacting the behaviour encouraged by the campaign, which may be unequally felt by different audiences. For example, if the behaviour takes significant time, those who are time-poor may not be able to enact the behaviour change required. Some inequality in uptake can be relieved if audiences are provided with sources of support and help. Barriers that produce this inequality are likely to be found around access to resources, cognitive load, and competing priorities. Campaigns that focus on individual behaviours without considering the role of someone’s environment or decision-making capacity are therefore unlikely to be effective in more disadvantaged populations.\nWhat should I do about campaign generated Inequalities?\nThere are always going to be groups that are harder to reach and find behaviour change more challenging, no matter how good a campaign is. To expect a campaign to tailor to complete success for all audience segments is a huge challenge, and although something to aim for, may be unrealistic in a lot of circumstances. However, as communicators with access to research and behavioural tools set out in this guide, we are able to spend time working out what the potential inequalities our campaign may generate, and then minimising such inequalities as much as possible within your campaign budget and a robust assessment of what you can achieve.\n\nTo improve equality in access:\n\nUse a combination of digital and non-digital channels.\nPartner with community leaders and other free public-facing services such as libraries or places of worship.\nUse language that is accessible for those with lower levels of literacy or English language skills.\nIn creative assets, use images of people that reflect the diversity of the campaign’s audience.\nTo improve equality in uptake:\n\nEnsure any research conducted to either diagnose a problem or evaluate your campaign contains a diverse representation of your target population.\nConsider how barriers to behaviour change vary across different audience segments, particularly for the most disadvantaged, and take this into account when designing the campaign and user journey.\nProvide an effective offline user journey as an alternative for those who lack digital access.\nProvide materials to help people navigate the required behaviour change, such as a physical pack or online chat box.",

        "name": "Implementation: Message design",
        "content": "This section sets out some strategies to design effective campaign messages and top lines.\n\nThese strategies are intended for campaigns that aim to change behaviour and drive action, rather than campaigns that intend to raise awareness or change opinion. However, some of the strategies may be applicable across all types of campaigns.\n\nPrinciples of message design\nIn order to effectively spur action, a message must:\n\nGet the target audience’s attention\nTell the target audience what they have to do\nMotivate the target audience to act\nOr to phrase it differently, the message must remove capability barriers (awareness of the message, and knowledge about the action required) and motivation barriers (why the audience should act).\n\nGet the target audience’s attention\nIn order to be successful, the message must get the attention of the target audience. They must understand that the message is meant for them, and they must not feel able to easily ignore the message.\n\nMessaging should mirror the words and language used by the target audience to make sure they can recognise themselves in the message. For example, in a message about trading goods internationally, messaging could address the audience as “Anyone who buys or sells goods from abroad”, rather than “Traders,” which some people may not use to describe themselves.\n\nPrompting questions to consider include:\n\nWill the audience recognise themselves in the message?\nWhat else might be competing for their attention?\nDoes the message use their familiar language and words?\nHow likely are they to trust the source of the message?\nIs the message easy for them to ignore?\nFor campaigns that try to encourage audiences to stop or reduce harmful behaviours, it might be more difficult to capture the audience’s attention. All people tend to disregard messages that warn about dangers, particularly where they already know that a behaviour is harmful but do not wish to stop (see section on Protection Motivation Theory).\n\nTell the target audience what they have to do\nWhen encouraging an audience to take action, the message should be as specific as possible about exactly what they must do. The audience should be able to picture themselves carrying out the action, and the message should give them the information they need to make a plan.\n\nFor example, a message stating “Eat more vegetables” is clear, but the action is not very specific and it may be difficult for the audience to translate the instruction into a plan. “Add an extra serving of vegetables to every meal” is more specific, and helps the audience to form a concrete and achievable plan.\n\nPrompting questions to consider include:\n\nIs the required behaviour clearly set out?\nIs the message in plain English?\nDoes the message help people form a plan of action?\nAre the next steps clearly signposted?\nDoes the message convey appropriate urgency and timelines?\nIs it clear in the message who is responsible for carrying out the behaviour?\nMotivate the target audience to act\nFinally, the message must motivate the target audience to act. The phrases chosen should be informed by analysis of the motivation barriers to action faced by the audience.\n\nAudiences can be motivated by positive messages (“Keep the park nice for everyone”) or negative messages (“Don’t turn the park into a rubbish dump”). Insight about your audience should reveal which kind of messages will resonate the most. When a campaign involves a series of communications, communicators may wish to start with more positive messages, shifting to a more negative tone later to drive up urgency for those who have not yet taken action.\n\nPrompting questions to consider include:\n\nWhy would anyone want to follow the instructions?\nAre the consequences of not doing anything clearly set out?\nDoes the message make people feel empowered to act?\nDoes the action sound fun, interesting, or intriguing?\nCommunicating about threats and risks\nProtection Motivation Theory describes how people typically behave in response to a threat or a risk.\n\nThis theory shows that individuals typically go through a two-stage decision making process in response to a threat: firstly, they appraise the risk, and secondly, they appraise how able they are to avert the risk through their behaviour.\n\nAccording to this theory, if people don’t feel that they are able to avert the risk through their behaviour, they will attempt to cope with their fear by engaging in undesirable behaviours, such as denial, disengagement, or panic.\n\nIf people do feel that they are able to avert the risk through their behaviour, they will attempt to cope with the danger by engaging in suitable protective behaviours.\n\nSo, when planning a campaign to encourage people to enact protective behaviours in response to risk, campaign messaging should both:\n\nHelp the audience understand how much risk they face\nGive the audience the confidence that they can reduce this risk through protective action, with clear instructions about what they should do.",

    {
        "name": "Implementation: Habits",
        "content": "What is a habit?\nHabit is an automatic behaviour or pattern of behaviour established through repetition of an experience and imprinted in neural pathways so that it doesn’t require conscious planning.\n\nHabits are often prompted by specific triggers, which are cues providing reminders of the previous action or routine, and helping us to perform it again. Triggers might be objects, actions, people, sounds, smells, or other elements of the external environment.\n\nBuild habits\nThere are a few principles communicators can draw on when a behaviour needs to be repeated for a successful behaviour change to take place:\n\nHelp audiences create their own environmental cues to encourage habit formation. For example, if a campaign is trying to encourage people to take reusable bags to the supermarket, communications could suggest keeping reusable bags by the front door as a physical reminder to take them along. If a campaign is promoting the benefits of regularly switching energy suppliers, communications could encourage audiences to enter a calendar appointment each year to regularly review their current tariff and explore alternatives.\nMake use of natural opportunities to change routines and habitual behaviours. Significant life changes (such as moving house or becoming a parent) offer an ideal opportunity to establish new habits, due to the disruption of existing routines and the development of new ones. For example, if a campaign is encouraging individuals to stop smoking, targeting this towards people who are undergoing other life changes (such as starting a new job, or retiring) may increase the effectiveness of the campaign by allowing people to adopt new habits in line with new daily structures.\nEncouraging new behaviour as an addition to an existing behaviour or routine is likely to boost new habit adoption. For example, some breast cancer charities routinely provide shower stickers that show how to perform a breast check. Instead of asking people to take time out of their day to specifically perform this breast check, this campaign instead encouraged audiences to perform the check while showering, an existing daily routine that can be adjusted to incorporate this new habit.",

        "name": "Evaluation: Introduction",
        "content": "Evaluation is about measuring whether the campaign has achieved its objectives. To evaluate effectively, the vision needs to be translated into a set of measurable campaign objectives with corresponding measures before the campaign is launched. If the evaluation method is not planned in advance, there is a risk that data to determine campaign effectiveness may not be available, or may be difficult to access.\n\nTo be able to identify whether and why the campaign was or was not effective, two things will be measured: the behaviour to influence (for example the proportion of girls choosing STEM subjects at A-level, or reporting rates of modern slavery) and the barriers to that behaviour (identified in the COM-B analysis).\n\nThis is because the campaign may only be designed to overcome one or two barriers, so its success at influencing the behaviour in question will partly depend on the strength of the other barriers at the time the campaign is running.\n\nFor example, a campaign designed to overcome the motivational barriers to frontline staff reporting modern slavery might have been very effective at overcoming motivational barriers, with staff highly engaged and motivated to make reports. However, if opportunity barriers (barriers outside the control of the audience) were present during the campaign, reporting rates might have remained stubbornly low – for example, if the telephone line to report such concerns had been unavailable. To avoid drawing incorrect conclusions about the campaign’s success, the behavioural outcome in question as well as the relevant barriers would ideally be monitored.\n\nAnother way of understanding this is to think back to the theory of change, which charts out all of the conditions that would need to be met in order for a particular behavioural outcome to take place. If any one of these conditions were not met, for example, because the campaign was unable or not designed to influence it, then the behaviour would not change. Measuring whether and to what extent these conditions are satisfied is therefore important where possible. This section provides guidance on how to do this.",

By measuring the impact of communication efforts, government organisations can refine their messaging, allocate resources effectively, and enhance the overall effectiveness of their communication campaigns.\n\nThe updated GCS Evaluation Cycle is designed to provide best-practice guidance for GCS colleagues to most effectively and efficiently evaluate communication activities across government.\n\nPurpose and Vision \nThe new GCS Evaluation Cycle outlines the steps and processes you need to plan and execute your evaluation, whether it is for major paid-for campaigns or low/no-cost communication activities. It builds on the foundations of the previous Evaluation Framework 2.0 but embraces a more dynamic and process-driven foundation which: \n\nEmphasises the importance of continuous learning, innovation and improvement.\nIntegrates close links to other frameworks such as OASIS. \nOutlines metrics that can be applied across all types of communication activity.\nThe GCS Evaluation Cycle encompasses industry-leading practices that will continue to drive improvements across the profession, enabling communicators to demonstrate the value and impact of campaigns and communication activities.  It equips communicators to effectively measure success while appraising learnings that will improve planning, design and impact of future communications. \n\nEvaluation Evolution \nThe GCS Evaluation Cycle provides information and guidance about which metrics to measure and what aspects to consider when planning and delivering a comms evaluation. This includes defining your communication objectives, considering the characteristics of your target audience, linking metrics to assess the impact of your communications, and identifying learnings. As each evaluation caters to different audience groups, communication objectives and more, this Cycle does not aim to be one-size-fits-all. Evaluators should assess the characteristics of your communication activity and take guidance from this Cycle where appropriate. \n\nThis guide will help you to:\n\nEmbed evaluation upfront as a core element in every communication plan.\nIdentify the consistent metrics used to measure different types of campaigns and low/no-cost communication activities.\nUnderstand the different aspects to consider when planning and delivering an evaluation for communication activities.\nIdentify and consider audience characteristics and difficult-to-reach audiences to ensure audience inclusivity.\nBuild clear connections between evaluation and other relevant GCS frameworks (e.g., OASIS, Theory of Change and COM-B for behaviour change).\nMeasure campaign success, both in real-time and throughout the campaign or communication activity. \nIdentify how evaluation results can contribute to the continuous improvement of corporate objectives and reputation management. \nExplore outside of existing ways of working to devise innovative solutions to address challenges more efficiently and effectively. \nThe GCS Evaluation Cycle replaces the GCS Evaluation Framework 2.0 and is an evolution that still includes the familiar evaluation components and metrics. However, these components and metrics have been updated to acknowledge and account for the evolving communications and audience landscape. \n\nBuilding on Cross-Government Expertise and Guidance\nThe Magenta Book is HM Government’s guidance document that details how to scope, design, conduct, use and disseminate evaluations. It explains how to incorporate evaluation through the design, implementation, and review stages of policymaking. Building on cross-government expertise on policy evaluations, the GCS Evaluation Cycle optimises the use of these evaluation principles for communication evaluations, making sure that target audience groups are reached and that behavioural science principles are considered. \n\nThe Magenta Book includes transferable concepts that apply to both policy and communication evaluations, GCS colleagues are recommended to utilise the Magenta Book alongside the Evaluation Cycle. This is so they can gain an understanding of an array of evaluation methods for different scenarios, things to look out for when conducting quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis, and guidance around how to share evaluation results and use these results to inform better communications in the future.",

        "name": "The GCS Evaluation Cycle",
        "content": "Stages of Evaluating Communication Activities and Campaigns\nThe GCS Evaluation Cycle is an agile framework for continuous assessment, rather than a linear evaluation. The agile nature of the Evaluation Cycle means you can utilise the aspects most relevant to your type of  communication activity. \n\nHowever, it is still important that a consistent set of metrics are used to measure the effectiveness of your communication activity. Consistent use of these metrics helps with choosing appropriate objectives for your communication activity and setting targets to measure success, such as key performance indicators (KPIs), to be established and tracked. Metrics are divided into inputs, outputs, outtakes and outcomes, in line with definitions widely used by AMEC and other professional bodies. Impact then summarises how the communication outcomes contribute to organisation and policy objectives. Finally, to intrinsically link the evaluation process to continuous learning and improvement, learning and innovation is embedded at the final stage of the cycle to capture strategic learnings that drive new ideas, learnings and improvements that can be taken forward. Learning and innovation should be linked back to the start of your communication planning, the Inputs phase. \n\nTherefore, the Evaluation Cycle consists of six stages:\n\nInputs – what you put in: evidence-based planning and content creation.\nOutputs – audience experience: the experience you delivered and created for your audience through the reach of your communications.\nOuttakes – audience perceptions: what they think, feel or intend to do because of your communication activities..\nOutcomes – audience behaviour: response from and/or behaviour of your audience. \nImpact – what you achieve: in terms of organisation and/or policy objectives and KPIs. \nLearning and Innovation – what you play forward: the lessons you take forward to improve the current or future communication activities.\nLearning and Improvement: the Core of the Evaluation Cycle \nAt the core of the Evaluation Cycle sits continuous learning and improvement. This marks the most crucial part of the model, as it defines the purpose of evaluating our communication – to learn and to improve. Learnings should be informed by things that went well and things that did not go so well to feed into current and future planning and implementation.\n\nContinuous Learning and Improvement – You should consider how measuring real-time digital metrics throughout your communication activity can generate new insights and thus potential improvements for the communication activity. If possible, you should implement these improvements to your communications when it is still ongoing. Guidance around delivering digital communications can be found in the Digital Discipline Operating Model.\n\nLearning and Innovation – Digestible lessons should be packaged up for use in the future. The learnings generated should feed back to inputs (stage 1 of the circular model) of a new evaluation cycle, so that any new communication activity can take on these lessons learnt. Learnings that can be applied or scaled more generally should be shared across government.  \n\nA diagram of the Evaluation Cycle, which shows a cyclical process with 6 steps (Inputs, Outputs, Outtakes, Outcomes, Impact, and Learning and Innovation) and the core of Continuous Learning and Improvements in the middle. \nDiagram A illustrates the GCS Evaluation Cycle, which defines evaluation as a recurring process.\n\nEvaluating different types of communications\nDifferent communication activities aim to engage the audience in different ways. Here are three categories of engagement goals: \n\nGoal 1: Awareness and attitudes\nIn the minority of cases, communications might primarily seek to raise awareness of an issue or to change people’s attitudes, with no behaviour changes anticipated, meaning measurement of Outcomes may not always be possible. However, even where the communication activity does not have a primary behavioural element, considerations should be made regarding how the communication objectives of increasing awareness or changing attitudes feed into overarching behavioural and policy objectives (more details on this are outlined in the Inputs section). \nGoal 2: Behaviour Change\nMost government communication seeks to change behaviours to implement government policy or improve society. This means that, in addition to tracking awareness metrics, evaluations should capture whether your target audience adopt the desired behaviour change, according to the purpose of “start”, “stop” or “maintain”. This is so that we can learn which methods, messages and channels are effective for encouraging successful behaviour change. \nGoal 3: Recruitment\nRecruitment is a specific form of behaviour change where people are encouraged to start an activity. This category encompasses major employment campaigns into public sector jobs rather than recruiting people to “register” or “take part”. Successful recruitment into public sector jobs is vital to maintaining public services and protecting the country. Recruitment campaigns for jobs such as teachers, nurses, and the armed forces share many characteristics, unique demands and broader societal impact, and thus benefit from a dedicated category. \nPaid-for Campaigns vs Low/No-cost Communications\nThe GCS Evaluation Cycle has been designed for any type of communications and campaigns, from low/no cost to paid-for campaigns.\n\nFor low-cost or no-cost campaigns: You should measure metrics most suitable to your communication activities at each stage. \n\nFor paid-for campaigns: \n\nGCS recommends that approximately 5-10% of total campaign resources are allocated to evaluation. Communicators should dedicate this to research and optimisation which can include both in-house and outside agency research. Paid-for campaigns are advised to measure as many of the suggested metrics as possible.\nGCS encourages all departments and organisations to spend up to 10% of their existing campaign budget on innovative techniques which we can test, ensuring we can continue to use public funds responsibly and judiciously whilst seizing new opportunities.

        "content": 'What are inputs?\nInputs are what you put in at the start – the planning and research that informs your communications or campaign. \n\nThis includes everything that must be done to prepare for the communication activity, which may include conducting research, reviewing previous learnings, planning evaluation design, determining budget and costs, etc.\n\nWherever possible, planning should be based on research evidence, insights and learnings to maximise your chance of delivering a successful campaign or communication activity. Successful communication activities and campaigns rely upon sufficient preparation.\n\nWhat are they used for?\nTo detail and reflect on what has been done to enable the communication activities.\nTo demonstrate that communications are based on evidence-based planning, research and previous strategic learnings. \nTo provide context for the outputs, outtakes and outcomes the campaigns generate so they can be evaluated in line with the budget and resources put into the communications activity. \nTo ensure clear links to policy and communication objectives and development of appropriate KPIs. \nTo make predictions and assumptions of how your communications Outputs would lead to Outtakes, Outcomes and ultimately Impact, one step at a time. \nTo consider innovative solutions and determine in what ways and how frequently these are evaluated during implementation.\nWhat’s included in INPUTS – Setting Objectives\nYour communications objectives should be set out according to the SMART principles:\n\nSpecific: clearly define what you want to achieve.\nMeasureable: determine a baseline and identify ways to track your progress.\nAchievable: set targets that are challenging but also realistic.\nRelevant: ensure your objectives align with your policy and organisation objectives.\nTime-bound: set a deadline for achieving your objectives.\nTo enable effective evaluation, your SMART objectives must: \n\nEstablish a current baseline measure if no communication activity were to take place.\nSet challenging targets that forecast the change your communication activity will make over a defined period of time.  \nProvide an explanation for the level of change being targeted. \nTo ensure your communication objectives are relevant they must be coherent to the aims and vision set out by your policy and organisational objectives. Consider questions like: \n\nHow do your communication objectives feed into the policy and organisation objectives?\nHow do your communication objectives feed into the specific behavioural changes required for the policy to succeed?\nDoes your communication activity reflect your organisation’s culture, values, and corporate objectives? \nThis is an example of different types of objectives and how they feed into the overall policy objective in a bottom-up manner.\n\n\nFor paid-for campaigns: You must set KPIs, a quantifiable measure which allows you to monitor progress towards your objectives throughout the campaign. The GCS SMART Targets Tool is designed to support campaign teams in setting challenging yet achievable KPI targets.\n\nWhat’s included in INPUTS – Communication Planning\nYou should make sure your communication plan covers the following considerations so you can be best prepared for the forthcoming stages in the Evaluation Cycle. This is not an exhaustive list, and you should expand on areas that matter most to your communication activity.\n\nEmbed in your OASIS plan\nThe OASIS campaign planning guide provides government communicators with a framework for preparing and executing effective communication activities. Within OASIS, Objectives and Scoring are especially important for the purpose of evaluation.\nFor more information on OASIS for evaluation, please refer to the section Linking to OASIS.\nEnsure inclusivity of audience groups\nAre you using behavioural insights to understand the target audience of your communication activity? \nHave you considered how activities will serve those with protected characteristics? \nHave you considered audience segmentation to help target your communications? \nLearn from best practice\nWhat has been learned from previous communications activities?How can you build upon previous performance?\nWho has done similar types of work before?\nWhat are the keys to success?\nWhat things have others tried that did not work? \nApply Theory of Change and COM-B where applicable, e.g., for a behaviour change campaign (you can learn more about Theory of Change and how to incorporate the COM-B model for behavioural considerations).\nConsider whether your target audience has the capability, opportunity and motivation to change their behaviour to identify the barriers these present and how your communications might need to overcome them. \nWhat beliefs/feelings would you like your audience to have?\nWhat audience behaviour would you anticipate?\nHow will your Outputs lead to your Outtakes, Outcomes, and ultimately Impact?\nConsider conducting activities in partnership\nWhat are the strengths of other organisations that you can capitalise on? \nWhat reputations would you favour in your partnership organisations? \nCan we work with other brands or organisations that have existing audience loyalties? \nEmbed outcome-focused innovation\nWhile existing methods might work adequately, are there new promising ways to deliver the communication objectives more productively, more effectively, or at a lower cost?\n\nHow can we best take advantage of emerging technologies?\nHow can we best adapt to evolving audience trends?\nPre-test/pilot\nCan your communication activity be piloted with a small audience sample? \nWhat metrics and opinions are you tracking and seeking in order to identify unintended consequences and serendipities? \n\nExamples of evaluation metrics for Inputs (not an exhaustive list):\n{\n"communication_metrics": [\n{\n"metric": "Total spend to date",\n"type": ["Awareness", "Behaviour change", "Recruitment"],\n"medium": "Online and/or Offline",\n"definition": "Aggregate total spend so far (online and offline), how much money has been spent on digital media, sum of one-off set up costs and periodic offline media spend updates",\n"measurement_method": "£"\n},\n{\n"metric": "Theory of change (including evidence base)",\n"type": ["Behaviour change"],\n"medium": "N/A",\n"definition": "Implementation of behavioural science in planning effective communication",\n"measurement_method": "Is it in place?/Is it evidence-based?"\n},\n{\n"metric": "Content creation",\n"type": ["Awareness", "Behaviour change", "Recruitment"],\n"medium": "Online and/or Offline",\n"definition": "Infographics, video, etc.",\n"measurement_method": "Volume by type"\n},\n{\n"metric": "Volume of press releases",\n"type": ["Awareness"],\n"medium": "Offline",\n"definition": "# of press releases sent out",\n"measurement_method": "# of press releases sent out"\n},\n{\n"metric": "Volume of social media releases",\n"type": ["Awareness"],\n"medium": "Online",\n"definition": "# of releases to owned social media channels",\n"measurement_method": "# of releases to owned social media channels"\n},\n{\n"metric": "Insights and Formal Learnings",\n"type": ["Awareness", "Behaviour change", "Recruitment"],\n"medium": "Offline",\n"definition": "Implementation of insights from research and/or learnings from previous evaluations",\n"measurement_method": "Is it in place?

This captures how successfully your communication activity has reached your target audience, which may include press coverage, public relations and impressions, as well as low/no-cost activities such as stakeholder engagement.\n\nIf the campaign has a behavioural change element, links should be made to the COM-B model. This allows you to consider the reach, distribution and/or exposure of your communications in relation to audience experience and how this influences capability, opportunity and motivation among your target audience. For example, how an Output might lead to a change in opportunity. (See more details about COM-B.) \n\nWhat are they used for?\nBy tracking Output metrics around target audience reach, you can determine how effective your communications or campaign approach was in reaching your target audience.

        "content": 'Audience segmentation is crucial to understanding your target audience’s characteristics, needs and interests. \n\nDividing your target audience into smaller segments based on their commonalities and differences helps you include and target hard-to-reach audiences. For example, by considering the appropriate language, tone, communicative channels, time, occasion, etc, to cater to each audience segment. \n\nAudience segmentation can help to:\n\nTarget your audience segments more efficiently by focusing your resources on the audience most likely to respond to your messaging.\nEnsure inclusivity for difficult-to-reach audience segments that are defined by subcultural norms.\nIncrease audience engagement by presenting messages relevant to their interests and needs and fostering better audience-messenger relationships and reputation.\nIncrease effectiveness by using messages that break down key barriers and subsequently lead to better Outtakes, Outcomes and Impact.\nMethods of Audience Segmentation\nThe table below breaks down methods of segmenting your audience.\n\n{\n"segmentation_methods": {\n"by_demographics": {\n"description": "Based on factors such as age, gender, location, income, education level, occupation, etc.",\n"pros": "Data is relatively easy to collect or readily available from databases.",\n"cons": "Prone to over-generalisation, where members in the same demographic group may not have the same interests or needs."\n},\n"by_golden_questions": {\n"description": "Using a set of questions set in a particular order to gauge your audiences needs, interests, and behavioural norms.",\n"pros": "Provides deep insights into the audiences needs and interests.\\nWith message targeting not bounded by demographic characteristics, you can cater even to subcultural norms.",\n"cons": "Golden questions are tailored to each campaign, which is generally more time-consuming and expensive to implement.

This will allow you to report metrics for each of your audience segments throughout the evaluation cycle. Setting out segments prior to campaign activity can allow for achievable targets for each group, meaning more detailed evaluation especially where campaigns are targeted. Any learnings should take into account the audience segmentations made and whether adaptations can be made to your Outputs as communication activity progresses to maximise success in achieving your desired Outtakes, Outcomes and Impact among audience segments. \n\nIt may be beneficial to set out your assumptions and predictions for how your different audience segments will experience your communication activity (“Outputs”) and how this is predicted to change their respective beliefs or feelings (“Outtakes”), and ultimately lead to the desired audience behaviour (“Outcomes”) in a Theory of Change. \n\nTheory of Change for Evaluation \nThe full guidance on Theory of Change can be found in the Magenta Book on GOV.UK. The Theory of Change for communication activity helps you capture considerations, assumptions and predictions about how your communication activity is expected to deliver behaviour change. Some key considerations during the stages of evaluation are:\n\nOutputs – The experience and reach of your communications/messaging among different audience groups and how this might affect your audience in terms of capability, opportunity and motivation to engage in the behaviour change as you predict.\nOuttakes – How your communications/messaging with the target audience leads to changes in beliefs and/or feelings. For example, the extent to which your audience agrees with your view/position before and after exposure to the communication activity.\nOutcomes – If your assumptions are supported by the evidence collected and behaviour change is observed as predicted.

        "content": "In communication activities that aim to drive behaviour change, one of the more challenging parts of the evaluation cycle is establishing how progress is made from “Outputs” to “Outcomes”. \n\nDuring the Inputs stage of the Evaluation Cycle, you need to plan ahead and envisage how audience experience (“Outputs”) will lead to audience beliefs and feelings (“Outtakes”) that align with the message of your communication activity, which ultimately lead to the desired audience behaviour (“Outcomes”). \n\nA behaviour change campaign will need to address barriers that might stop your target audience from engaging in the desired audience behaviours. The COM-B model identifies three barriers: \n\nCapability – whether your target audience has the right knowledge, skills, physical and mental ability to carry out the behaviour. \nOpportunity – whether your target audience has the right resources, and the right systems, processes and environment around them to empower them to undertake the behaviour.\nMotivation – whether your target audience wants to or believes that they should carry out the behaviour and establish habits based on it.\nBy setting out a strong basis for your audience experience (“Outputs”) that adequately addresses these three barriers, you will maximise the chances of them engaging in the desirable Behaviour.

        "name": "Calculating Return on Investment (ROI)",
        "content": "GCS recommends using the following five-step process:\n\nObjectives: These should be focused on quantifiable behavioural outcomes (such as the number of direct foreign investments generated, or the number of teachers recruited).\nBaseline: Establish the status quo or expectation for the metrics in question if we do nothing. \nTrend: A forecast of how the baseline will naturally move over the period of measurement. For example, if there has been an 8% reduction in the adult smoking rate over the last 15 years, we expect that the next year will see a 0.5% reduction, all other things being equal. \nIsolation: Exclude or disaggregate other factors that will affect the outcome you are measuring to make sure that the change observed has been caused by the campaign.\nTo accurately assess the impact of a recruitment campaign, compare new hires to the existing employment rate. \nCommunication activity that is accompanied by a tax or legislative change should try to apportion the total observed effect between the different methods of government policy implementation\nExternalities: Consider how well your campaign achieved your intended outcomes. On top of that, be aware of and track unintended effects – they can be positive serendipities or negative consequences. For example, the launch of a smoking discouragement campaign could aim to promote citizens’ health and alleviate stress in the healthcare system. A serendipity may be improved air quality in city parks, and an unintended consequence may be increased substance abuse in other forms, e.g., alcohol. \nAssumptions\nAssumptions often form a core part of calculating ROI. Assumptions should be reasonable, clearly identified and, if possible, justified. Part of the post-campaign evaluation will involve refining assumptions and considering their validity. \n\nROI: a worked example\nThe following example is fictitious, only to demonstrate the process.\n\nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) is running a campaign costing £3 million to reduce the volume of inappropriate A&E attendances for low-urgency cases. The campaign aims to divert people to a GP surgery where they can be better and more efficiently taken care of.\n\nObjectives\nThe campaign will reduce the number of inappropriate NHS England A&E attendances by 3% or 85,000 in 2018/19 compared to the 2017/18 baseline of 2,865,377.\nBaseline\nThe appropriate baseline for comparison here is the previous 12 months of operational data or observations. In 2017/18 there were 23,878,145 A&E attendances in England. 12% of these were found to be “inappropriate” (did not require A&E attendance as could have been handled by a GP or pharmacist). The baseline for inappropriate attendances is 2,865,377 (23,878,145 × 0.12).\nTrend\nOver the past three years, we have seen a steady increase in A&E attendances of 2% year-on-year, driven by population growth and other factors. We can forecast 24,355,708 attendances (23,878,145 x 1.02) in 2018/19. The rate of inappropriate attendance has remained broadly constant at 12%. The trend-adjusted baseline for inappropriate attendances is therefore 2,922,685 (24,355,708 × 0.12).\nIsolation\nThe NHS is also starting to provide and promote out-of-hours GP surgery appointments. The rate of inappropriate A&E attendance is 4.5 percentage points higher than average at times when GP surgeries are not currently open. We assume that the new offer of out-of-hours service by GPs will reduce the total number of inappropriate attendances by 2.25 percentage points (half of the total observed effect because this only affects half the hours in a day). We expect this to independently reduce the number of inappropriate attendances observed by 65,760 (2,922,685 × 0.0225) to 2,856,925.\nExternalities\nAside from the direct cost benefit of optimising points of treatment across NHS frontline services (in the conclusion), there are indirect benefits or positive externalities that should be considered in this case. Inappropriate attendances rarely have to be treated, so there will be a negligible cost for this, and operational overheads will remain as a fixed cost. A reduction in inappropriate A&E attendance of 3% is approximately equivalent to a 3% uplift in staffing resources (which can be redeployed to urgent cases). The total annual cost of A&E operation is £2.7 billion and staffing makes up 30% of this, which is equal to £810 million. 3% of £810 million is equal to £24.3 million. The indirect benefit of optimising A&E attendance, or the effective “opportunity cost” of not optimising staff resources, is £24.3 million. \nIn conclusion, the average cost of an A&E attendance is £148. The average cost of a GP appointment is £46. Therefore, every potential A&E attendance that is redirected to a GP reflects a saving to the NHS of £102 (£148 – £46). \n\nIf 85,000 cases are redirected in this way, the health service overall will be £8,670,000 (£102 × 85,000) better off. \n\nThe positive externalities generated also create £24.3 million of value for the public sector and society. \n\nThe total benefit of this campaign, or return on investment, will be £32.97 million. For every £1 spent on this campaign, society will be £11 better off. This is commonly expressed as a ratio, in this case, 11:1. \n\nThese results can be validated after the campaign has run by comparing the actual number of inappropriate A&E attendances with the isolated trend-adjusted baseline of 2,856,925.",

        "name": "Measuring Reputation",
        "content": "The reputation of an organisation is now well established as an indicator of organisational success. Positive reputations are associated with supportive behaviours from stakeholders, while negative reputations are associated with less support or even hostile responses from stakeholders. Despite good evidence on this link, there is still much confusion about how to best measure and manage reputation, with many seemingly competing models and approaches. \n\nAssessing organisational reputation serves as an essential tool to gauge performance and inform strategic decisions. Through this section, informed by over 20 years of insights from the John Madejski Centre for Reputation, we aim to simplify the process.\n\nWhen considering reputation management, remember to consider:\n\nWhose opinion matters most regarding reputation\nWhat specific elements of the organisation’s reputation are under scrutiny\nHow managing these elements of reputation will help you achieve your policy objectives\nIdentifying Your Audience\nOrganisations have different reputations with different groups and individuals. Identifying which stakeholders are integral to your mission is imperative. This selection must be guided by an understanding of your organisation’s objectives and whom it intends to serve. Factors such as the influence and legitimacy of these stakeholders, as well as the urgency of their concerns, should inform your response. In the dynamic landscape of stakeholder engagement, prioritise judiciously rather than reacting to the most vocal demands, which are frequently amplified by social media platforms.\n\nIt is therefore important to consider aspects of organisational purpose, stakeholder need, and legitimacy before responding to stakeholders and when managing and measuring reputation. At its best, choosing to measure reputation with a particular group can help to give them a voice, allow your organisation to listen, and guide and justify the actions of your organisation. \n\nFocusing on Reputation Elements\nIn practice, reputation is often measured as an aggregate of stakeholders’ trust and respect for an organisation. This is sometimes referred to as “emotional appeal”. This aggregate measure of reputation allows organisations that are different (e.g., the armed services vs Amazon) to be compared in terms of the extent to which  they are trusted. \n\nHowever, reputation is also shaped by a range of aspects including;:\n\norganisational characteristics (e.g., products, leadership, financial performance)\nrelationships (e.g., customer service, listening, the appropriate use of power)\nthird party influence (e.g., whether important third parties recommend your organisation)\nUnderstanding and measuring these underlying drivers is vital for creating effective change strategies. They can be defined and measured as the causes of reputation that make stakeholders trust or respect your organisation. Where data allows, measuring these factors and causally linking them to reputation through multivariate statistical analysis is important in helping to develop a Theory of Change. For example, if good service experience is found to be a key factor driving trust in the HMRC, it would be reasonable to focus activities on service if it was cost-effective.\n\nPurpose-Driven Reputation Management\nReputation management strategies should be aligned with the behavioural outcomes you aim to achieve among stakeholders. Whether you are encouraging certain actions, discouraging others, or maintaining desirable behaviours, the desired change must be clearly articulated. Rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach, tailor your strategies to specific contexts and stakeholder groups, and recognise that maintaining existing positive behaviours is typically more straightforward than instigating new actions or dissuading entrenched habits.\n\nMeasuring Your Progress\nIt is important to measure not only reputation but also its causes and consequences in a way that allows you to establish robust correlations. Employing tried-and-tested measurement scales and analytical techniques, such as multivariate regression, will enable you to discern which experiences influence reputation and subsequent behaviour patterns. In this way, you will be able to identify which stakeholder experiences link to reputation and its associated consequences. It is also important to include measures that benchmark your organisation against other organisations, especially in terms of aspects of trust and respect. \n\nOverall, knowing your audience, understanding what shapes your reputation, and being clear on your goals will greatly improve your reputation management.",
